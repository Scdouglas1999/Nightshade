# GET /api/status is registered as a public (no-auth) route in
# apps/desktop/lib/headless_api/routes/system_routes.dart, so this works
# even when NIGHTSHADE_AUTH_TOKEN is set. The server serves either plain
# HTTP or HTTPS (self-signed by default) on the same port depending on
# NIGHTSHADE_TLS*, so probe http first and fall back to https with -k
# (the cert is self-signed; identity is pinned by clients via the SPKI
# fingerprint, not a CA chain — `-k` here is fine for a liveness probe).
