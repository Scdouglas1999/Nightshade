Pick a target, connect the gear, frame it, run the sequence, guide, keep an eye on the
weather, and look at what you got — without switching between five programs that each know
a different half of the story.

Everything works off the same target, the same equipment profile and the same running
session. The planetarium knows what your camera's field of view is. The sequencer knows
where the target will be at 3am. The weather screen knows where you are.

Underneath, a Rust core runs the sequence and processes the frames. The desktop app, the
browser dashboard and the Android app are all windows onto that one running session, so
closing a window doesn't end your night.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a public beta. It runs a real rig under a real sky — that's where it gets
> developed and fixed — but my gear isn't your gear. Watch a full session on your own
> equipment before you leave it running unattended, and have a look at
> [what's missing](docs/known-limitations.md).

Nightshade is capture software, not a Fujifilm driver. If you came here looking for Fuji
support in N.I.N.A. or ASCOM, you want [Fujicom](https://github.com/Scdouglas1999/Fujicom)
or the [N.I.N.A. Fujifilm plugin](https://github.com/Scdouglas1999/NINA-Fujifilm-Native-Plugin).

## What else is in there

Sequences are built from steps, and the steps cover the awkward parts: retries, meridian
flips, dithering, V-curve autofocus, calibration frames, and conditions and loops around any
of it. If the machine restarts mid-run, the sequence can pick up where it left off.

When the app doesn't know whether it's safe — no weather data, a sensor that's gone quiet —
it treats that as *not safe* rather than assuming things are fine. Bad weather, a full disk
or an emergency stop can pause the run and send the mount to park with the dome and cover
shut.

Automated decisions get written down as they happen, so when something goes wrong at 2am you
can read back what the app thought it was doing instead of guessing.

There's a fair amount beyond plain capture, too:

- **Your Sky** builds a personal atlas out of your own plate-solved frames, filling in as
  you shoot more.
- **First Light** goes through transient candidates and cross-matches them. It can submit to
  TNS directly; AAVSO and MPC come out as files you send yourself.
- **Constellation** and **Collaborative Sky** handle shared calibration libraries, mosaic
  panels a group can split between them, and live shared sessions. They only work against a
  server you or your club runs — there's no public Nightshade server and no default address.
- **Science tools** for photometric calibration against catalogue references, period
  analysis, and report exports.
- **Backup** to a local folder, WebDAV, or S3-compatible storage (AWS, MinIO, Backblaze),
  with credentials kept in your operating system's keyring.

## Running it from somewhere else

You can run Nightshade as a normal desktop app, or leave it running on the computer at the
telescope and connect from elsewhere. The machine with the hardware stays in charge either
way.

| | Good for | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Desktop app** | Setting up, planning, imaging, going through results | Everything |
| **Headless host** | An observatory PC you don't sit at | The same program with `--headless`, plus a password-protected API |
| **Web dashboard** | Checking from any browser on the network | Served by the host at `/dashboard`, nothing to install |
| **Android app** | Checking from bed, or stopping something | Pairing, monitoring, and camera, mount and sequencer control |
| **A second PC** | A proper remote control room | The full app mirroring the live session over the network |

<div align="center">
<img src="assets/screenshots/web-dashboard.png" width="820" alt="Nightshade browser dashboard with device, camera, mount, filter wheel, focuser, rotator, sequencer, guiding and planetarium panels">

<sub>The browser dashboard, served by the host at <code>/dashboard</code>.</sub>

</div>

A few things worth knowing before you put a host on a network:

- It only listens on the local machine (port 8080) until you set up a password. Putting it
  on the network without one takes a deliberate command-line flag.
- With no password set, anything that matters returns "not authorised". Only pairing and the
  dashboard page stay reachable, so a fresh machine can still be set up.
- Access tokens can be view-only, control or admin, or limited to particular things.
- Push notifications work over your own network out of the box. Push from outside your
  network is written but does nothing until you supply your own Firebase or Apple
  credentials.

Read the [secure setup guide](docs/headless-secure-setup.md) before exposing a host to a
network you don't control, and the [firewall notes](docs/troubleshooting/firewall.md) if a
second device can't find it.

## Hardware

Nightshade talks to gear four ways. A yes means Nightshade can look for and connect to
devices that way on that platform — what any individual driver can actually do is up to the
driver, and it tells you once it connects.

| | Windows | Linux | macOS | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **ASCOM COM** | Yes | — | — | Needs the ASCOM Platform and your device drivers installed |
| **ASCOM Alpaca** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Network devices and bridges |
| **INDI** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Needs an INDI server it can reach; how much works varies by driver |
| **Native SDK** | If installed | If installed | If installed | Only works once you've installed the manufacturer's own library and driver |

This is the same table the app shows under Settings → Connection. If they ever disagree,
that's a bug worth reporting.

There are native camera drivers for **ZWO ASI, QHY, Player One, SVBony, Atik, FLI, Moravian
and the Touptek family**, and native mount support for **SkyWatcher/Synta, iOptron and
LX200-style serial mounts** (Meade, OnStep, Losmandy, 10Micron). The downloads here contain
none of the manufacturers' own libraries — those paths only light up once you've installed
the vendor's driver yourself.

**Plate solving needs ASTAP or astrometry.net.** Install one and point Nightshade at it;
there's no solver built in.

**Guiding** works through PHD2, or with Nightshade's own multi-star guider.

Have a look at the [hardware list](docs/supported-hardware-by-platform.md) before building a
profile.

## Downloads

| File | Platform | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nightshade-7.1.0-windows-x64.zip` | Windows x64 | Portable — extract and run. Only code-signed once a certificate has been set up |
| `nightshade-7.1.0-linux-x64.tar.gz` | Linux x64 | Portable bundle, needs glibc 2.35 or newer. Early days |
| `nightshade-7.1.0-android-arm64-v8a.apk` | Android | The companion app. Also built for `armeabi-v7a` and `x86_64` |

**There's no macOS or iOS build.** The Mac version compiles, but nothing is packaged and
neither has ever been run against hardware. Treat them as source only.

Every file comes with a `.sha256` so you can check it downloaded intact. The desktop
archives also contain the licence, the third-party notices, and a note of the exact commit
they were built from.

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows package includes an updater, and the app can check signed update files. Until
> signing keys and an update server are set up, **the updater refuses everything and
> updating is manual**. Self-updating is Windows-only anyway. Back up your settings and
> database before replacing a copy.

**What you need to run it.** On Windows: Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit), 8 GB of RAM (16 GB is
better), a reasonably modern GPU, and the ASCOM Platform if you use ASCOM drivers. On Linux:
64-bit with glibc 2.35 or newer, an OpenGL 3.3 GPU, and GTK 3, libsecret, libusb, libudev
and OpenSSL. USB gear also needs the manufacturer's udev rules and the right group
membership. Allow about 500 MB for the app, plus room for your catalogues and frames.

## Getting started

1. Download the file for your platform from
   [Releases](https://github.com/Scdouglas1999/Nightshade/releases/latest), and check the
   `.sha256` if you want to be careful.
2. Extract the whole thing somewhere you can write to. Don't run it from inside the zip.
3. Start it — `nightshade_desktop.exe` on Windows, `./nightshade` on Linux. Windows may warn
   about an unsigned program; check the hash first if that bothers you.
4. **Download the sky catalogues on first run.** They aren't bundled, because they're large.
   Settings → Catalogs → Download catalogs fetches the star and deep-sky catalogues, about
   60 MB. Until you do, the planetarium only has a handful of bright stars and the planner
   has nothing to score.
5. Install whatever your rig needs that Nightshade can't ship: the ASCOM Platform and your
   drivers on Windows, an INDI server on Linux, PHD2 if you guide with it, and ASTAP or
   astrometry.net for plate solving.
6. Connect your first device and save an equipment profile.

Longer versions: [installation](docs/getting-started/installation.md) →
[first connection](docs/getting-started/first-connection.md) →
[first image](docs/getting-started/first-image.md).

To run it as an observatory machine instead:

```
nightshade_desktop --headless --require-auth
```

## What's missing

Everything knowingly left out or unfinished in this release is written down, with what it
means for you and whether there's a way around it:

**[docs/known-limitations.md](docs/known-limitations.md)**

The short version: there's been no full unattended night from dusk to dawn, no second-device
test across a firewall, no macOS or iOS build, no code signing or update server, the
switch-device path is unverified, and INDI weather and switch support needs checking on a
real Linux observatory before you trust it to keep things safe overnight.

## Building it yourself

It's a Flutter workspace over a Rust core, joined with `flutter_rust_bridge` and managed with
Melos. Use the scripts — they keep the generated code and the native libraries in step.

```bash
dart pub global activate melos
melos bootstrap
./scripts/dev.sh          # Linux and macOS
```

On Windows that's `melos run dev` instead.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./scripts/dev.sh` / `melos run dev` | Regenerate the bridge, build Rust, launch the desktop app |
| `./scripts/dev.sh --skip-frb` / `melos run dev:quick` | The same, without regenerating the bridge |
| `melos run generate` | Regenerate the database, model and bridge code |
| `melos run test` | Run the tests |
| `melos run analyze` | Static analysis |
| `melos run build:desktop:linux` | Build the Linux release |
| `melos run build:desktop:windows` | Build the Windows release |

CI uses Flutter 3.44.1 and stable Rust. Platform prerequisites, and what to do when the
bridge misbehaves, are in the [developer docs](docs/index.md) and the
[bridge guide](docs/FRB_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Support the project

Nightshade is free. There's no paid version, no locked features, and nothing held back for
subscribers.

If you'd like to help fund it, [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/SeanDouglas) is the way
to do that. It pays for hardware to test against, packaging, documentation, chasing down
driver compatibility, and the long tail of things that only break at 3am under a real sky.
(GitHub Sponsors isn't set up.)

</p>

The most useful thing you can send me is a bug report, especially about hardware I don't
own. Tell me your operating system, how you connect to the device, exactly what gear and
driver versions, which step of the sequence, what the logs say, and what you actually saw
happen. Have a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) first. If you find a
security problem, please report it privately through [SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md).

## Licence

Nightshade is source-available, which isn't the same as open source. You can read, build and
audit it under the terms in [LICENSE](LICENSE). Please read those terms before redistributing
it or building something on top of it.
