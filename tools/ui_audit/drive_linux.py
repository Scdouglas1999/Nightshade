"""Drive the Nightshade desktop app on Linux for audit sweeps.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Audits that read source find the bugs source review can find. The defects that
have actually cost this project a night's data -- a Pause button that does not
pause, a run that reports "completed" with zero frames, a status that contradicts
itself between two APIs -- only appear when the real binary is driven. This is
the harness that drives it: a scratch-profile app instance on a private X server,
with screenshots, a live accessibility tree, and keyboard/pointer input.

The accessibility tree is what makes a sweep checkable rather than impressionistic:
it reports every control's NAME, ROLE and STATE, so "is this switch on?" and "is
this button dead?" have answers that do not depend on squinting at a screenshot.
It does NOT report geometry -- this build's AT-SPI bridge times out on the
Component interface -- so clicking is `shot`, look, then `click-xy`. Use `click`
only to ask whether a named control is present and enabled.

ENVIRONMENT NOTES (each of these cost a debugging session to learn)
  * GALLIUM_DRIVER=softpipe, not llvmpipe. Under Mesa 26 llvmpipe crashes this
    app's shader setup on a virtual display; softpipe is slow but survives.
  * NIGHTSHADE_DATABASE_DIR points at a scratch dir so a sweep never mutates the
    developer's real observing data, and so each run starts from a known state.
  * The app takes a single-instance lock. A second launch exits silently and
    looks identical to a crash, so `start` refuses when one is already up.

USAGE
  drive_linux.py start [--display :77] [--profile NAME] [--fresh]
  drive_linux.py shot  out.png
  drive_linux.py tree  [--filter TEXT]
  drive_linux.py click "Settings"        # by accessible name
  drive_linux.py click-xy 400 300
  drive_linux.py key Escape
  drive_linux.py type "M31"
  drive_linux.py resize 420 900          # reflow to a phone-width viewport
  drive_linux.py resize --show           # report the current window geometry
  drive_linux.py log [--tail N]
  drive_linux.py stop

WHY `resize` EXISTS
-------------------
The window came up at a fixed 1600x900 and the harness could not change it, so
every responsive branch below the phone/tablet breakpoints -- the sequencer's
phone builder, the guiding screen's mobile tabs, the fullscreen image viewer
that is gated on `Responsive.isPhone` -- was unreachable and the coverage
ledger recorded them all as "needs an emulator". Most of them do not: they are
window-width branches on the very same desktop binary. `resize` drives
`xdotool windowsize`, which works without a window manager because Flutter's
GTK window accepts the configure directly.

    of a million tokens in images alone, before any tool output. The three
    largest transcripts are exactly the three agents that died mid-run.

    Two thirds of that was avoidable waste:
      * the app window is 1600x900 inside a 1920x1200 root, so a root capture is
