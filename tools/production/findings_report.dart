// Renders every swept finding into one triage document, ordered by what hurts.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// A sweep produces findings as a pile of per-area JSON files, which is the right
// shape for machines and useless for deciding what to fix on a Tuesday. Worse,
// a pile invites the failure this whole campaign exists to stop: skimming the
// interesting-sounding ones, fixing those, and calling the area done.
//
// So this orders strictly by severity — using the VERIFIER's corrected severity
// where one exists, not the reporter's — and prints the unverified ones in their
// own section rather than mixing them in, because "nobody has tried to reproduce
// this yet" is a materially different claim from "an adversarial reviewer failed
// to refute it".
//
// USAGE
//   dart run tools/production/findings_report.dart
//   dart run tools/production/findings_report.dart --severity P0,P1
