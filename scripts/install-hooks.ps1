# Install the Nightshade pre-commit hook on Windows.
#
# Run once after cloning the repo from PowerShell:
#   .\scripts\install-hooks.ps1
#
# The hook itself is a bash script (scripts/pre-commit.sh). Windows git
# invokes hooks via the bundled MSYS2 bash, so .sh works on Windows out
# of the box as long as Git for Windows is installed.

# Reference: docs/code-quality/audit-tests.md §7 recommendation #1.
