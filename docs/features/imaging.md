- Quick switching between configurations
- Examples: "High Gain Ha", "Low Gain RGB", "Unity"

#### Binning

Combines pixels for faster readout and better signal-to-noise:
- **1x1**: Full resolution
- **2x2**: 4x faster, 1/4 resolution
- **3x3**: 9x faster, 1/9 resolution
- **4x4**: 16x faster, 1/16 resolution

**When to Bin**
- 2x2 or 3x3 for framing and focusing
- 2x2 for narrowband imaging (oversampled)
- 1x1 for maximum detail

#### Region of Interest (ROI)

## Focus Tab

Sharp focus is critical for quality images. Nightshade offers both automatic and manual focusing.

### Automatic Focusing

**V-Curve Autofocus**

The most reliable autofocus method:

1. Click **Auto Focus**
2. Nightshade will:
   - Take exposures at different focus positions
   - Measure HFR (Half-Flux Radius) for each
   - Create V-curve graph
   - Move to position with lowest HFR
3. Results show:
   - Best focus position
   - Achieved HFR
   - V-curve graph

**Autofocus Settings**
- **Step Size**: Focuser steps between measurements (50-500)
- **Number of Steps**: Total measurements (7-15 typical)
- **Exposure**: Duration for focus images (1-10s)
- **Binning**: Higher binning for speed (2x2 or 3x3)
- **Backlash**: Compensation for focuser gear backlash (0-500 steps)

**Best Practices**
- Use bright star for focusing
- Start with larger steps to find approximate focus
- Refine with smaller steps
- Run autofocus:
  - At start of session
  - After filter changes
  - When temperature changes >2-3°C
  - If stars look soft

### Manual Focusing

**Manual Focus Mode**

For fine-tuning or when autofocus isn't available:

1. Click **Start** in Manual Focus section
2. Select a bright star (double-click on preview)
3. Take a focus frame (continuous loop)
4. Use focuser in/out buttons
5. Watch HFR value decrease
6. Stop when HFR is minimized

**Focus Aids**
- **HFR Display**: Real-time star sharpness (lower = better)
- **FWHM**: Full-width half-maximum (alternative metric)
- **Star Profile**: Graph showing star intensity profile
- **Bahtinov Mask**: Overlay for Bahtinov pattern (requires mask)

**Step Size**
- Coarse: Large steps (100-1000) for initial focusing
- Fine: Small steps (10-100) for critical focus

### Focus Graph

- Tracks focus position over time
- Plots HFR vs. time or temperature
- Visualize focus drift
- Useful for determining refocus intervals

### Temperature Compensation

**Auto Refocus by Temperature**
- Enable temperature-based autofocus
- Set temperature change threshold (e.g., 2°C)
- Nightshade auto-refocuses when threshold exceeded

**Focus vs. Temperature Curve**
- Learn relationship between temperature and focus
- After several data points, predict focus position
- Auto-adjust focus as temperature changes

### Filter Focus Offsets

Manage focus position differences between filters.

**Filter Offset Controls**
