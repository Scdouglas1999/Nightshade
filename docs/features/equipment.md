# Equipment Management

The Equipment screen is your central hub for discovering, connecting, and managing all your astrophotography devices. Nightshade supports multiple connection protocols to ensure compatibility with virtually any equipment.

## Overview

The Equipment screen is organized into three tabs:
- **Discovery**: Find and connect new devices
- **Connected**: Manage currently connected equipment
- **Settings**: Configure device-specific options

## Connection Protocols

Nightshade supports four connection protocols, each with different strengths:

| Protocol | Platform | Best For | Requirements |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **ASCOM** | Windows only | Direct driver access, widest Windows compatibility | ASCOM Platform + device drivers |
| **INDI** | Linux/macOS | Native Unix support, open-source drivers | INDI server + drivers |
| **Alpaca** | All platforms | Network devices, remote imaging | Alpaca server on device |
| **Native** | All platforms | Direct SDK access, best performance | Vendor SDK (bundled) |

### ASCOM (Windows)

The industry standard for Windows astronomy software.

**Setup**
1. Install [ASCOM Platform](https://ascom-standards.org/)
2. Install manufacturer's ASCOM driver for each device
3. In Nightshade Discovery tab, select "ASCOM" protocol
4. Available devices appear in the list

**Supported Devices**
- Cameras (including cooled CCD/CMOS)
- Mounts (GoTo, tracking control)
- Focusers (absolute and relative)
- Filter wheels
- Rotators
- Domes
- Weather stations
- Safety monitors

### INDI (Linux/macOS)

The standard protocol for astronomy on Unix-like systems.

**Setup**
1. Install INDI server: `sudo apt install indi-full` (Ubuntu/Debian)
2. Start INDI server with your drivers, or let Nightshade auto-start
3. In Nightshade Discovery tab, select "INDI" protocol
4. Enter INDI server address (default: localhost:7624)

**Auto-Start Feature**
- Nightshade can automatically start INDI drivers
- Configure drivers in Settings → Equipment → INDI Drivers
- No need to manually run `indiserver`

### Alpaca (Network)

ASCOM's network-based protocol for cross-platform device access.

**Setup**
1. Run Alpaca server on device (e.g., ASCOM Remote, INDIGO)
2. In Nightshade Discovery tab, select "Alpaca" protocol
3. Enter device IP address and port
4. Scan for available devices

**Use Cases**

2. **Camera** - May need to set cooling
3. **Focuser** - Needed before focusing
4. **Filter wheel** - For filter changes
5. **Guider** - After main camera ready
6. **Auxiliary** - Weather, dome, etc.

### Profile Organization

- Create profiles for different setups
- Name clearly: "Backyard - Main", "Remote Observatory"
- Include notes about equipment combinations
- Export backups periodically
