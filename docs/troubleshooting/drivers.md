# Driver Troubleshooting

Driver issues can look like discovery failures, connect timeouts, unsupported
controls, corrupted frames, or device disconnects during long sessions.

## Choose the Right Backend

- Use ASCOM COM only on Windows.
- Use Alpaca for network devices and ASCOM bridges.
- Use INDI when a supported INDI server and driver are available.
- Use native SDK paths only when the release package includes the needed vendor
  library for the current OS.
- Use simulator paths to separate Nightshade workflow issues from hardware
  issues.

## Install And Verify

1. Install the platform runtime first, such as ASCOM Platform or INDI.
2. Install the device-specific driver or vendor SDK.
3. Reboot or reconnect hardware if the vendor installer requires it.
4. Test the device in the vendor utility or platform diagnostic tool.
5. Start Nightshade after the device works outside Nightshade.

## Common Driver Failure Modes

- Another app has exclusive access to the device.
- A stale driver service is still running after an update.
- The device firmware requires a newer driver.
- A USB-to-serial adapter is using the wrong COM port or missing its driver.
- A native vendor SDK DLL/shared library is missing from the release bundle.
- The driver exposes fewer capabilities than the UI control expects.

## When To Reinstall

Reinstall or update the driver when:

- The device does not appear in the OS device list.
- The vendor utility cannot connect.
- ASCOM Diagnostics, `indi_getprop`, or the Alpaca status page cannot see the
  device.
- The driver crashes or disappears during basic commands.

## Release-Gate Evidence

For public-release sign-off, record backend, driver version, vendor utility test
result, Nightshade discovery result, connect result, and any native library that
must be bundled or deliberately excluded.
