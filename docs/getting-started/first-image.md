# Capturing Your First Image

This guide will walk you through capturing your first astrophoto with Nightshade 2.0.

## Prerequisites

Before capturing images, ensure:
- [ ] Camera is connected (see [First Connection](first-connection.md))
- [ ] Mount is connected and tracking (optional but recommended)
- [ ] You have a target in view (Moon, bright planet, or star field)
- [ ] Camera lens cap is removed (yes, it happens!)

## Quick Start: Single Exposure

The fastest way to capture your first image:

### Step 1: Navigate to Imaging Screen

1. Click **Imaging** in the left sidebar (camera icon)
2. The Imaging screen will open with multiple tabs

### Step 2: Configure Camera Settings

1. Select the **Camera** tab
2. Set your exposure parameters:

   **Exposure Time**
   - Start with 1-5 seconds for testing
   - Longer for deep sky, shorter for planets/moon

   **Gain**
   - Start with Unity Gain (often around 100-150, varies by camera)
   - Lower for bright targets, higher for faint targets

   **Offset**
   - Use manufacturer's recommended value (usually 10-50)

   **Binning**
   - Start with 1x1 (no binning) for full resolution
   - Use 2x2 for faster framing/focusing

   **File Format**
   - FITS recommended for astrophotography
   - TIFF also supported

3. Set **Save Location**:
   - Click the folder icon
   - Choose where to save your images
   - Create a new folder for tonight's session

### Step 3: Cool Your Camera (if applicable)

If you have a cooled camera:

1. Enable **Cooling**
2. Set target temperature (typically -10°C to -20°C)
3. Wait for temperature to stabilize (shows "At Temp" when ready)

### Step 4: Take Your First Exposure

1. Go to the **Capture** tab
2. Click the large **START EXPOSURE** button
3. Watch the progress bar as the exposure runs
4. When complete, the image will display in the preview area

### Step 5: Review Your Image

The captured image appears in the preview:

- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel or pinch to zoom
- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around
- **Stretch**: Adjust the histogram slider to see faint details
- **Statistics**: View image stats (mean, median, HFR) in the info panel

## Taking Multiple Exposures

To capture a series of images:

### Step 1: Set Up Image Series

1. In the **Capture** tab, find the exposure controls
2. Set **Count**: Number of exposures (e.g., 10)
3. Set **Delay**: Time between exposures (usually 0-5 seconds)

### Step 2: Configure File Naming

1. Click **File Settings**
2. Set naming pattern:
   - Use placeholders: `{object}_{filter}_{num}_{exp}s`
   - Example result: `M42_Lum_001_180s.fits`
3. Enable **Auto-increment** to avoid overwriting files

### Step 3: Start the Sequence

1. Click **START EXPOSURE**
2. Nightshade will capture the specified number of images
3. Progress shows: "Capturing 3 of 10..."
4. Each image auto-saves to your chosen location

### Step 4: Stop if Needed

- Click **STOP** to abort the current exposure
- Click **ABORT SEQUENCE** to stop the entire series

## Setting Up for Deep Sky Imaging

For longer, unguided exposures:

### Step 1: Frame Your Target

1. Use short exposures (1-2 seconds) with high binning (2x2)
2. Slew the mount to your target:
   - Use **Imaging** > **Mount** tab for manual slewing
   - Or use **Planetarium** screen to select and slew to objects
3. Adjust mount position until target is centered

### Step 2: Focus Your Telescope

Critical for sharp images:

1. Go to **Imaging** > **Focus** tab
2. Select a bright star
3. Click **Auto Focus** to run automatic focusing routine
   - Nightshade will take a series of exposures at different focus positions
   - Automatically finds the sharpest focus
4. Or use **Manual Focus**:
   - Click **Start** to begin live focusing mode
   - Adjust focuser in/out
   - Watch HFR (Half-Flux Radius) value - lower is better
   - When HFR is minimized, you're in focus

### Step 3: Start Guiding (Optional but Recommended)

For exposures longer than 30-60 seconds:

1. Go to **Imaging** > **Guiding** tab
2. Ensure PHD2 is running and connected
3. Click **Start Guiding** in Nightshade
4. PHD2 will calibrate (if needed) and begin guiding
5. Wait for "Guiding" status before starting exposures

### Step 4: Configure Long Exposure Settings

1. Return to **Imaging** > **Camera** tab
2. Set exposure time (e.g., 180 seconds = 3 minutes)
3. Set appropriate gain for your target
4. Enable dithering (in Guiding tab) to reduce noise patterns

### Step 5: Start Imaging

1. Go to **Capture** tab
2. Set number of exposures (e.g., 30-50 for a deep sky target)
3. Click **START EXPOSURE**
4. Monitor progress:
   - Watch guiding graph for tracking quality
   - Check histogram to ensure you're not over/underexposed
   - Monitor temperature if using cooled camera

## Using Filter Wheels

If you have a filter wheel connected:

1. In **Camera** tab, you'll see **Filter** dropdown
2. Select desired filter (Lum, Red, Green, Blue, Ha, OIII, etc.)
3. Filter wheel will rotate to selected position
4. Wait for "Filter: [Name]" status before exposing

To capture through multiple filters:
- Take exposures with one filter
- Change filter
- Take exposures with next filter
- Or use **Sequencer** to automate filter changes

## Image Preview and Plate Solving

### Live Preview

Each captured image displays automatically:
- Latest image shows in preview pane
- Previous images accessible via thumbnail strip
- Click thumbnail to view earlier exposures

### Plate Solving

To verify your framing and get precise coordinates:

1. Capture a test image (30+ seconds for better star detection)
2. Click **Plate Solve** button in the image toolbar
3. Nightshade will analyze star patterns and determine:
   - Exact RA/Dec of image center
   - Field of view
   - Image rotation angle
4. Results overlay on the image
5. If solving fails, ensure:
   - Image has enough stars (may need longer exposure)
   - Approximate coordinates are known (helps solver)

## Saving and Managing Images

### Auto-Save Settings

1. Go to **Equipment** > **Settings** tab
2. Under **Imaging**:
   - **Auto-save captures**: Enabled by default
   - **Save location**: Choose default folder
   - **File naming**: Set pattern and auto-increment
   - **Create subfolders**: Organize by date/session

### Manual Save

To save a specific image:
1. Select image in preview
2. Click **Save** button
3. Choose location and filename
4. Select format (FITS/TIFF)

### Image Library

All captured images are tracked:
1. Go to **Analytics** screen
2. Browse by session, date, or target
3. View statistics and thumbnail previews
4. Click to open full image

## Troubleshooting First Exposures

### Image is completely black
- Check lens/dust cap is removed
- Verify camera is actually exposing (check progress bar)
- Stretch the histogram - very faint targets may appear black at linear stretch
- Try brighter target (Moon, Jupiter) for testing

### Image is completely white (saturated)
- Exposure too long or gain too high for your target
- Reduce exposure time
- Lower gain setting
- Use neutral density filter for very bright objects

### Image is blurry/elongated stars
- **Out of focus**: Use Focus tab to achieve critical focus
- **Tracking issues**: Check mount is tracking and polar aligned
- **Wind/vibration**: Wait for calmer conditions or add weight to mount
- **Exposure too long**: Reduce exposure time for unguided imaging

### Camera not responding during exposure
- Don't disconnect USB during exposure
- Don't close Nightshade during exposure
- If frozen, wait for exposure timeout, then reconnect camera
- Check USB power delivery is sufficient

### Files not saving
- Check disk space at save location
- Verify write permissions to folder
- Check folder path is valid
- Look for error messages in Equipment > Settings > Logs

   - Flats (use Flat Wizard)
   - Bias frames for calibration
   - Essential for high-quality final images

4. **Build Imaging Plans**
