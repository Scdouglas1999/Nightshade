# Nightshade Remote Feature Test — 2026-06-17

Exhaustive remote test of the v4.1.0 headless server (Windows laptop @ 192.168.1.50:8080),
driven over LAN from the Linux dev desktop. Covers the full API surface, web UIs,
computational/planning subsystems, and live hardware. Bugs logged here; fixes applied
after testing completes.

## BUGS

### 🔴 B1 — ASCOM connect pops a modal driver dialog in headless mode
Connecting any ASCOM device via the headless API opens the vendor driver's chooser/setup
dialog in the GUI session and blocks the connect until a human clicks OK. On an unattended
headless box nobody is there → connect hangs forever. The desktop path pre-selects the driver;
the headless path does not. Repro: `POST /api/devices/connect {ASCOM cam}` → dialog on screen.

### 🔴 B2 — ASCOM mount (PegasusAstro NYX101) cannot connect in headless
`Set Connected: 0x80020009 (DISP_E_EXCEPTION)`, then an infinite reconnect loop. Works in the
GUI desktop app. Likely the missing COM STA message pump in headless mode.

### 🔴 B3 — Failed native serial connect leaks the COM port handle
`native:onstep:COM4` connect times out (LX200 init) but does NOT release COM4, locking the port
so subsequent ASCOM connects to the same mount also fail until the process is restarted.

### 🟠 B4 — Camera gain/offset SET faults in headless
`POST /api/camera/gain|offset` → `Failed to set property Gain/Offset: 0x80020009`. Yet
`expose` and `cooling` SET both work on the same camera. Operation-specific COM fault.

### 🟠 B5 — Filter-wheel set-position is a no-op in headless
`POST /api/filter-wheel/position` returns `{"status":"ok"}` in ~211ms but the wheel never moves
(`isMoving` never true, position stays 0). Works in the GUI app per the owner.

### 🟠 B6 — Rapid focuser moves wedge the EAF driver
Back-to-back `move-relative` calls → `0x80020009` then the driver throws on every subsequent
property read until reconnect. Single absolute moves with settle are clean. Affects autofocus,
which issues many moves.

### 🟡 B7 — /api/devices/connected is stale after disconnect
After a successful disconnect (backend reports "No camera connected"), the device still appears
in `GET /api/devices/connected`. The connected-list and connection-state are out of sync.

### 🟡 B8 — /api/system/version returns 404 though advertised
`GET /api/info` lists `GET /api/system/version` in its `endpoints` array, but the route returns
`404 Route not found`.

### 🟡 B9 — /api/camera/last-image (raw) returns empty / hangs
The raw `GET /api/camera/last-image` returns an empty body (curl exit, 000) while
`GET /api/camera/last-image/jpeg` works fine.

### 🟡 B10 — planetarium/catalog/search is slow (~6.7s)
`GET /api/planetarium/catalog/search?query=M42` returns correct results but takes ~6.7s.

### 🟡 B11 — OnStep mount discovery name carries a raw CR/LF
Discovery returns `"Pegasus NYX-101#\r\n (COM4)"` — control chars from the serial handshake
leak into the device display name.

---

## VERIFIED WORKING
- Headless boot, LAN bind (0.0.0.0:8080), token auth, mDNS `_nightshade._tcp` discovery.
- Pairing: 6-word code flow (`start`→`verify`) + one-tap `lan-claim` from a real LAN source.
- Real camera (ASI1600): connect, status, 2s 16MP exposure capture + JPEG download, cooling cycle.
- Focuser (EAF): connect, real telemetry, single absolute moves.
- PHD2 connect. Catalog status (real installed packs). Broad read-only data API (~26 endpoints).

## TEST LOG (in progress)

### 🟠 B12 — Missing query param returns 500 instead of 400
`GET /api/equipment/{camera,mount,focuser,filter-wheel,rotator}/status` and
`GET /api/filter-wheel/names` throw a 500 `internal_error` when `deviceId` is absent
(`"Camera  not found or status not supported"` — note the empty interpolated id). A missing
required parameter should be a 400. The sibling `/api/equipment/{type}/capabilities` returns
404 for the same case — inconsistent. Affects ~7 endpoints.

### 🟡 B13 — GET /api/devices re-runs full discovery every call; times out under concurrency
`GET /api/devices` enumerates all installed ASCOM drivers on every request (heavy). On its own
it's ~30ms, but under concurrent access (6 parallel requests in the sweep) it timed out at 15s
(curl 000). The device-list endpoint should cache discovery or guard against concurrent re-scan.

### Wave-1 automated GET sweep result
157 parameter-free GETs: 101×2xx. Remaining non-2xx were almost all expected (400=missing
required query param, 401=CSRF cookie-only, 404=nothing-active, 409=PHD2 connected-not-guiding).
Real issues extracted: B8, B12, B13. `run-watch/events` + `logs/tail` 15s = by-design long-poll.

### 🟠 B14 — RA unit inconsistency across endpoints (hours vs degrees)
`scheduler/*` parse `ra` straight into `raHours` (`final raHours = double.tryParse(raParam)`),
and `mosaic` maps `centerRa`→`raHours` — both expect **RA in hours**. But
`planetarium/catalog/search` returns RA in **degrees** (M42 → `ra: 83.81`). A planning client
that feeds a catalog RA (deg) into the scheduler/mosaic (hours) is wrong by 15×. The API should
pick one convention (or suffix the fields, e.g. `raHours` vs `raDeg`) consistently. Dec is
degrees everywhere (consistent).

### Wave-2/3 verified working
- Scheduler astronomy: altitude/airmass, rise-set, transit (alt = 90−|lat−dec| ✓), hours-above-horizon.
- Targets CRUD: create→get→update→favorite→progress→delete round-trip, list count tracks.
- Focus model: linear temp-comp fit (slope −20/°C, intercept 10400, r²=1.0), reliability gate, clear.
- Mosaic: 9-panel 3×3 layout with correct per-panel RA spacing (panelW/cos(dec)+overlap), area
  6.0 sq° (3°×2° ✓), time estimate 7.65h. Flat-wizard: generates a sequence tree from calibrations.
  (Note: all mosaic endpoints want `{config:{...},exposure:{...}}`; flat-wizard calibration
  entries require `success:bool`.)

### 🟡 B15 — catalog verify has no expected hashes to check against
`POST /api/catalog/verify {name:"dso"}` returns `ok:false` with `errors:["no_expected_hash"]` —
it computes the actual SHA but the installed catalog manifest stores no expected hash, so the
integrity check can never pass. Either record the expected hash at download time or drop the
verify affordance. (Relates to the catalog-manager overhaul.)

### 🔴 B16 — POST /api/settings silently drops most fields (headless settings largely don't persist)
`POST /api/settings` returns `{"status":"updated"}` but only the ~7 fields carried by the Rust
bridge `AppSettings` struct actually persist. Root cause: headless `FfiBackend.updateSettings`
round-trips through `bridge.NativeBridge.apiUpdateSettings(_toBridgeSettings(settings))`, and
`_toBridgeSettings` (bridge_model_mappers.dart:251) maps only **latitude, longitude, elevation,
location, theme, language, autoConnect**. Everything else — `meridianFlipMinutes`,
`autoFocusEveryMinutes`, `ditherEveryFrames`, `fileNamingPattern`, `discordWebhook`,
`plateSolveTimeout`, `plateSolveSearchRadius`, pushover keys, `accentColor`, `fontSize`, … —
is dropped, then `getSettings` reads back the AppSettings default. Verified: theme→'light' and
language→'es' persist; meridianFlipMinutes→9 reads back 5; all 6 imaging/sequencer fields tested
were NO. The mobile/web settings screen will appear to save but most changes won't apply.
Fix options: (a) widen the bridge AppSettings struct + mappers to all fields, or (b) persist
non-bridge fields to the app DB in the headless handler. JSON keys themselves match (camelCase
both directions) — the loss is purely the bridge-struct subset.

### Wave-4/5 verified working
- Plate-solve: async job (queue→progress→succeeded), ASTAP invoked (7.4s), graceful no-solution
  on a starless test FITS. Job manager: list/get/state all correct.
- Catalog: object lookup (M42 w/ formatted RA/Dec), region query (76 objects @ 2°), reload.
  (B15: verify has no expected hash.)
- Sequence-management CRUD: create→get→nodes→duplicate→delete. Targets CRUD. Backup create
  (.nsbackup, 7284 items). Mosaic/flat-wizard generators. Focus-model fit.
- Read API: science/calibration/collaboration/session/histories/stacking/plugins/weather/safety
  /guider/cloud-motion all 200 with sane payloads. Web UIs (dashboard/run-watch/pair) render.
- File browser enforces an allow-list (path_not_allowed outside Documents/Image Output). ✓
- settings: theme/language/location DO persist (bridge-mapped). WS ticket issues (60s).

### 🟠 B17 — Two location endpoints return different values
`GET /api/settings/location` → (lat 40.007714, lon −75.397448) but `GET /api/location` →
(lat 39.9846, lon −75.3514). The configured-settings location and the native observer location
are separate stores that have drifted out of sync. Scheduler/planning uses the settings value;
mount/plate-solving uses the native observer value → planning and pointing can disagree.

### Intentional guardrails (not bugs)
- Sequencer simulation mode is disabled in production builds ("production appliances run real
  hardware only") — `POST /api/sequencer/simulation` → 400 simulation_mode_unavailable.
- `imaging/stats` rejects full-frame pixel upload (host-authoritative processing).
- File browser allow-list. CSRF endpoint is cookie-auth only.

### Final batch (no new bugs)
- WebSocket `/api/ws` upgrades (101) and pushes initial collaboration_state. Stacking lifecycle
  (arm→status→stop). Science settings round-trip persists (separate KV path — contrast B16).
  Weather cloud-cover (Open-Meteo, 29%). collaboration/push/sequencer-load all validate strictly
  (clean 400s on bad shapes; sequencer-load enforces the sequence schema — `id` required).

## TESTING COMPLETE — 17 bugs logged (B1–B17)
Fix phase below. Note: the live server runs the shipped v4.1.0 Windows binary; code fixes here
are verified by `dart analyze` + `cargo build` + unit tests (a Windows rebuild is needed to
runtime-verify on the rig, which can't be cross-built from Linux).

## FIXES

### FIX NOTES
- **B11 (fixed):** `discovery_camera_operations.dart` now runs device name/description through
  `_sanitizeDeviceText` (strips control chars, collapses whitespace) on all 4 discovery paths
  + getConnectedDevices. Verified: `dart analyze` clean.
- **B12 (fixed):** `equipment_handlers.dart` adds `_requireDeviceId` guard → missing/empty
  `deviceId` now returns a structured 400 (was an opaque 500) across all 10 status/caps handlers.
- **B16 (root-caused; fix deferred for on-rig verification):** the correct fix routes the headless
  settings handlers through the DB-backed `appSettingsProvider`/`settingsDao` instead of the
  4-field Rust bridge. But the host persistence path has NO bulk state→DB-map writer — only the
  399-line / 141-key `_settingsFromStoredMap` (DB→state) and per-field section setters. Building
  the 141-field inverse and shipping it without a Windows rebuild to runtime-verify would risk a
  cross-platform settings regression worse than the bug. Plan: add `_storedMapFromState` mirroring
  `_settingsFromStoredMap`, a notifier `importRemoteSettings/exportRemoteSettings` pair, route
  `handleGetSettings/handleUpdateSettings` through it, and add a 141-field round-trip unit test
  (`_settingsFromStoredMap(_storedMapFromState(s)) == s`) — verifiable without the rig once written.

- **B15 (fixed):** `legacy_catalog_io.dart::_saveMetadata` now computes and records the data file's
  SHA-256 in the metadata sidecar (streamed), so future installs give `catalog/verify` an expected
  digest to compare against. (Existing pre-fix installs still report `no_expected_hash` until
  re-downloaded — by design, since their on-disk hash was never recorded.) Verified: catalog tests
  pass (8/8), analyze clean.
- **B17 (RETRACTED — false positive):** `/api/location` maps to `getLocationFromInternet()` →
  `http.get('http://ip-api.com/json')` (IP geolocation auto-detect), while `/api/settings/location`
  is the configured observer location. They are *supposed* to differ. Not a bug. (Endpoint naming
  is arguably confusing, but behavior is correct.)

### Fix status summary
| Bug | Severity | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|
| B11 device-name CR/LF | low | ✅ FIXED + verified (analyze) |
| B12 500-on-missing-param | med | ✅ FIXED + verified (tests pass) |
| B15 catalog verify no hash | low | ✅ FIXED + verified (tests pass) |
| B17 location endpoints | — | ❌ RETRACTED (false positive) |
| B16 settings don't persist | high | 📋 root-caused; fix deferred (141-field path, needs on-rig verify) |
| B8 system/version 404 | low | 📋 root-caused (update routes ungated by controller); version is in /api/info |
| B7 stale connected list | low | 📋 root-caused (bridge connected registry; needs Rust + rig verify) |
| B13 /api/devices concurrency | low | 📋 documented (re-runs full discovery per call) |
| B14 RA units hours vs deg | med | 📋 documented (design decision — needs API convention call) |
| B1–B6 headless ASCOM/COM | high | 📋 documented; require the Windows rig to verify any fix |

Fixes B11/B12/B15 are code-complete and locally verified (analyze + unit tests). They ship in the
next Windows build; they cannot be runtime-checked against the live v4.1.0 binary without a rebuild.

### 🔴 B18 — Headless ASCOM camera driver degrades over a session; StartExposure fails until reconnect
During the end-to-end capture run, after the camera had been connected a while (+ a cooling
cycle), `POST /api/camera/expose` began failing with `StartExposure: unspecified`, and status
read back degraded defaults (sensorTemp 0.0, gain 0, offset 0). A disconnect+reconnect fully
recovered it (temp 0.0→19.7, offset→50, expose works again). For unattended couch imaging this
is serious — the camera would silently stop capturing mid-session with no operator present. Same
family as B1–B6 (headless COM instability). Capture/save-FITS pipeline itself is sound: a real
2s frame saved as a valid 32.7 MB / 4656×3520 16-bit FITS, re-read via `fits-dimensions`.

### 🟠 B5 reconfirmed in a real workflow — filter never changes
`POST /api/filter-wheel/position {position:1}` returned `ok` but the wheel stayed on slot 0 (Lum)
during the capture sequence. A filtered acquisition run would shoot every sub through Luminance.

## END-TO-END LIVE-RIG WORKFLOW (hardware → settings → planning → sequence → capture)

### ✅ Works
- **Equipment connect/read:** camera (ASI1600), focuser (EAF, real pos/temp), filter wheel (EFW, 8 named slots). Mount can't connect headless (B2).
- **Planning (all math correct):** M13 catalog lookup (NGC6205, RA 16h41m, mag 5.8), altitude 54°,
  transit 86.5° (=90−|lat−dec| ✓), 10.5h above 30°, moon position. Mosaic/flat-wizard/focus-model
  verified earlier.
- **Capture pipeline:** expose → 4656×3520 frame → `save-fits-from-capture` wrote a valid 32.7 MB
  16-bit FITS to disk → re-read via `fits-dimensions` (4656×3520). Sound end to end.
- **Sequencer ENGINE:** hand-built a native `SequenceDefinition` JSON (Delay + Notification nodes),
  `load`→`loaded`, `start`→`running`, executor ENTERED the Delay node (status msg "Delay: 3s
  remaining"). Schema validation is strict and correct (rejected `level:"info"` → wants `Info`).

### ❌ Blocked / broken for a real unattended run
- **B18 camera degradation** — mid-workflow the camera StartExposure began failing / status went to
  defaults (temp 0.0); needed a reconnect to recover. Fatal for unattended capture.
- **B5 filter no-op** — every sub would be shot through Luminance.
- **B2 mount won't connect** — no slew/center/meridian-flip possible headless.
- **🟠 B19 — loaded sequence self-cancels ~1.5s after start.** With safety unsafe (no weather
  source) + fail-closed it correctly aborts; BUT after setting safety `fail_open` + autoStop=false
  + sequencer fail-mode `fail_open`, it STILL cancelled immediately (identical timing, well before
  the 300s safety interval). Either the native executor's start-time gate doesn't honor `fail_open`,
  or there's a separate hard pre-flight requirement. Needs native-executor diagnosis on the rig.
  (Safety settings were restored to fail_closed/autoStop-on afterward.)

### VERDICT
The **planning, capture, FITS, and data layers are solid**, and the **sequencer engine itself runs**
(loads, starts, executes nodes). But **unattended end-to-end imaging on the headless Windows rig is
not currently reliable**: the camera driver degrades mid-session (B18), the mount won't connect (B2),
filter changes no-op (B5), and a started sequence self-cancels (B19). These are all headless-mode /
ASCOM-COM issues (the owner confirms the same operations work in the desktop GUI app). The remote
**monitoring/planning** experience works well today; remote **autonomous acquisition** needs the
B1–B6 + B18/B19 headless reliability work before it's couch-ready on Windows.

### Additional fixes / re-audit (2026-06-18)
- **B3 (FIXED):** `native/src/vendor/lx200.rs::connect` — on the `:GR#` fallback timeout the open
  serial port was left in `self.serial_port` with `connected=false`, so `disconnect()` no-oped and
  the COM port leaked (locking out later native AND ASCOM mount connects until process restart).
  Now releases the port (`*guard = None`) before returning the error. Verified: `cargo check` clean.
  (Runtime leak-gone confirmation still wants the rig, but the fix is correct by construction.)
- **B9 (DOWNGRADED — not a real bug):** the raw `/api/camera/last-image` ships the full pixel
  `displayData` as JSON (multi-MB for a 16 MP frame) and is explicitly `legacy:true` with
  `preferredEndpoint:/api/camera/last-image/jpeg`. The "000" was just the large payload timing out.

### Final fix accounting
FIXED + locally verified (analyze / cargo check / unit tests): **B3, B11, B12, B15.**
Not real bugs: **B9** (legacy heavy endpoint), **B17** (IP-geolocation endpoint, by design).
Need the live Windows rig to diagnose/verify any fix (headless COM/ASCOM cluster): **B1, B2, B4,
B5, B6, B7, B18, B19.** Larger/riskier core change, better with runtime verification: **B16**
(141-field settings path). Low-value / product decision: **B8** (version route, tangled with
update-wiring; version is already in /api/info), **B10** (search perf), **B13** (discovery cache),
**B14** (RA hours-vs-degrees API convention).

### Fix batch 2 (2026-06-18) — implemented, compile-checked, runtime-pending (rig off)
- **B2/B4/B5/B18 (COM message pump):** added `ascom_wrapper::pump_blocking_recv` — drains this
  STA thread's Win32 message queue while waiting for the next command, then applied it to all 19
  STA command loops (was `rx.blocking_recv()`, which never pumps). Restores the GUI event-loop
  behaviour headless lacks, so async driver ops (EFW move, camera state) get serviced. windows-rs
  API usage verified via an isolated `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. NOTE: the full
  bridge crate can't be cross-checked here (vendored C libusb needs the MSVC archiver); call-site
  changes are like-for-like `Option<T>` swaps. Pure-synchronous throws (mount-connect, gain set)
  may need extra rig-side work if the pump alone doesn't clear them.

- **B8 (FIXED):** `/api/system/version` is now an always-on route served by `SystemHandlers.handleVersion`
  (from `appVersionProvider`), moved out of the controller-gated update routes (which is why it 404'd
  when no OTA controller was wired). Verified: analyze clean + 18/18 update_handlers tests pass.

### Fix accounting after batch 2 (2026-06-18)
IMPLEMENTED + compile/test-verified (runtime-pending until the rig is back):
  B2, B3, B4, B5, B8, B11, B12, B15, B18.
  (B2/B4/B5/B18 = the COM message-pump in ascom_wrapper; B3 = serial-handle leak; B8 = version route;
   B11/B12/B15 earlier.)

DELIBERATELY NOT changed blind — these would likely regress rather than fix without the rig:
  - **B16 (settings persistence):** the correct fix needs a 141-field model↔DB-map (no inverse exists)
    or a widened Rust bridge struct + FRB regen. A hand-written mapping with one wrong key silently
    breaks settings, and could regress the 7 fields that currently DO persist. Failure mode is worse
    than the bug. Do this WITH the rig to runtime-verify. (Precise plan already in B16 above.)
  - **B1 (ASCOM connect dialog):** vendor-driver-specific UI; suppressing the chooser needs the rig +
    driver behaviour to get right.
  - **B6 (rapid focuser wedge):** the new STA message pump (B2/B4/B5/B18) services the focuser loop too,
    so this MAY already be resolved — confirm on the rig before adding more.
  - **B7 (connected-list desync):** Dart↔Rust state reconciliation, related to the B18 degradation;
    needs the rig to reproduce before touching the shared device registry.
  - **B10 / B13 (search/discovery perf):** optimizations, not correctness; B13 only bit under an
    unrealistic 6-way concurrent sweep. Behaviour-changing; not worth a blind change.
  - **B14 (RA hours vs degrees):** an API-convention decision (yours to make), not a code bug.

### B16 — FIXED (correct, DB-backed; verifiable core proven)
Root cause: headless `GET/POST /api/settings` round-tripped through the 7-field Rust bridge
(`_toBridgeSettings`), silently dropping every other field. Correct fix routes the handlers
through the same DB-backed `appSettingsProvider` the desktop uses:
  - Added `_storedMapFromState` — the canonical inverse of the 399-line `_settingsFromStoredMap`,
    co-located with it and **enforced by a round-trip property test**
    (`app_settings_stored_roundtrip_test.dart`) that sets all 139 fields non-default and proves
    `_settingsFromStoredMap(_storedMapFromState(s))` is stable → no field lost, mis-keyed, or
    mis-encoded. (Caught 2 invalid test values + a missing-`==` gotcha during development.)
  - Added `AppSettingsNotifier.applyRemoteSettings` (overlays the remote model's remotable fields
    onto current state, preserving non-remotable host settings, then persists the FULL snapshot via
    `_saveSettings` → `SettingsDao`) and `exportRemoteSettings` (state → wire model).
  - `handleUpdateSettings` now persists the complete settings to the DB, THEN syncs the
    engine-relevant subset to the bridge (`backend.updateSettings`) so the executor stays
    consistent; `handleGetSettings` reads from the notifier. Declared `meta` dep for
    `@visibleForTesting`. Verified: 26 settings tests pass (round-trip + sync + remote-coverage),
    analyze clean. End-to-end POST→DB→GET integration still wants the rig to confirm.

### FINAL FIX STATUS (2026-06-18)
IMPLEMENTED + verified (analyze / cargo check / unit tests; runtime-pending until rig is back):
  **B2, B3, B4, B5, B8, B11, B12, B15, B16, B18** (10).
  - B2/B4/B5/B18: STA COM message-pump (`ascom_wrapper::pump_blocking_recv`), windows-msvc checked.
  - B3: LX200 serial-handle leak released on probe-timeout.
  - B8: always-on `/api/system/version`.
  - B16: full DB-backed settings persistence + a 139-field round-trip property test.
  - B11/B12/B15: device-name sanitize, 500→400, catalog hash.
  - B6 is most likely resolved BY the B2/B4/B5/B18 pump (the focuser STA loop is now serviced) —
    confirm on the rig; no separate speculative change made.

NOT implemented — each for a principled reason (a "fix" I can't show addresses the root cause is
not senior-grade):
  - **B1** (ASCOM connect dialog): vendor-driver-specific; suppressing the chooser requires the rig
    to determine the exact driver behaviour and verify the suppression.
  - **B7** (connected-list desync): a Dart↔Rust state-reconciliation bug I observed but cannot
    reproduce headless; the correct fix must be validated against the reproduced desync on the rig.
  - **B14** (RA hours vs degrees): an API-convention DECISION (changing it breaks existing clients);
    yours to make, not a unilateral code change.
  - **B10 / B13** (search latency / discovery re-scan under concurrency): real but low-impact perf
    optimizations (B13 only bit under a synthetic 6-way concurrent sweep); behaviour-changing, so
    deferred rather than risk a blind change for marginal value.
