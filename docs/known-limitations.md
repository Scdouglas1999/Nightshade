# Known Limitations

This page is the public-release holding area for limitations that are accepted
for a release candidate. Do not use it to hide blockers. An accepted limitation
must be documented, understandable to users, paired with a workaround when one
exists, and reflected in release notes.

## 6.1.0 Verified Scope

> **6.1.0 adds no new hardware validation.** The most recent real-hardware evidence remains the 6.0.0 Windows bench run between 22 and 26 July 2026 against an ASCOM Pegasus NYX-101 mount, a native ZWO ASI1600MM-Cool camera, and a ZWO EFW filter wheel, alongside a simulator instance. Camera connect, cooling, exposure, and image download are exercised on that hardware. **The mount was never commanded to move**, so slew, sync, park, unpark, homing, and meridian flip are unexercised on real equipment. **No frame was taken under a real sky** — the acquisition path is validated, the sky is not. 6.1.0 changes guiding correction behaviour and native target scoring; both are unit-tested only and **neither has been run on sky**. The web dashboard and the Android companion were driven against a running host, but a second physical device on a real LAN with a firewall in the path was not tested for either release. Fully-unattended **headless** acquisition and a full-night soak are **not** verified and must be supervised. **Linux** is early testing; **macOS** and **iOS** are unbuilt, untested, and ship no artifact. Every other device path — switches, domes, covers, and the remaining vendor SDKs — is **capability-gated**: present in the app, but not a support guarantee until it is verified on your rig.

## 6.0.0 Verified Scope (previous release)

This is the scoped capability statement for the current release. It must match
the README "What is actually verified" section and the `## What's verified`
section of [`release/v6.0.0.md`](release/v6.0.0.md) word for word:

> Real-hardware validation for 6.0.0 was a Windows bench run between 22 and 26 July 2026 against an ASCOM Pegasus NYX-101 mount, a native ZWO ASI1600MM-Cool camera, and a ZWO EFW filter wheel, alongside a simulator instance. Camera connect, cooling, exposure, and image download are exercised on that hardware. **The mount was never commanded to move**, so slew, sync, park, unpark, homing, and meridian flip are unexercised on real equipment. **No frame was taken under a real sky** — the acquisition path is validated, the sky is not.

Evidence: the *Hardware validation* section of
[`release/v6.0.0.md`](release/v6.0.0.md). A dedicated
`release-evidence/6.0.0.md` has not been cut yet.

## 5.0.0 Verified Scope (previous release)

This is the scoped capability statement that matched the 5.0.0 README callout,
the 5.0.0 release notes, and `supported-hardware-by-platform.md` word for word.
It is retained as the historical record for 5.0.0 and is superseded by the
6.0.0 statement above:

> Nightshade is verified on **Windows**, where the desktop app drives ASCOM/Alpaca
> cameras, focuser, filter wheel, and PHD2, with plate-solving and planning. Remote
> **monitoring and planning** over the LAN — from the web dashboard and the Android
> companion — are verified. Fully-unattended **headless** acquisition on real ASCOM
> hardware is **still being hardened** and should be supervised. **Linux** is in
> early testing; **macOS** builds in CI with no hardware soak. Every other device
> path is **capability-gated** — present in the app but not a support guarantee
> until verified per rig. The 5.0 Living Sky, automation-unification, and
> desktop master/slave paths are automated/local-stack verified but still need
> a supervised physical-rig and real second-machine LAN validation.

Evidence: [`release-evidence/5.0.0.md`](release-evidence/5.0.0.md).

## Acceptance Rules

A limitation can be accepted only when all of these are true:

- the behavior is intentional for the release scope
- the user impact is documented plainly
- unsupported controls are disabled or fail with an explicit reason
- safety-critical workflows fail closed
- the limitation is included in release notes
- a future owner or tracking issue exists when follow-up is expected

If any item affects mount safety, unattended imaging safety, data loss,
credential exposure, or package install/upgrade integrity, treat it as a
release blocker unless the release explicitly removes that workflow from scope.

## Current Release Candidate Limitations

These are the accepted limitations for the 5.0.0 release candidate.

| Area | Limitation | Impact | Workaround | Release blocker? | Owner/issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware/platform | Official archives do not redistribute vendor SDK libraries; native paths are capability-gated by user-installed libraries and OS driver availability. | Some vendor devices require ASCOM, Alpaca, or INDI instead of native mode. | Install a compatible vendor library/driver or use a verified backend listed in `docs/supported-hardware-by-platform.md`. | No; packaging and release notes state the boundary. | Track vendor-specific verification in the support matrix. |
| Hardware/platform | ASCOM COM is Windows-only. | Linux and macOS users cannot use local ASCOM COM drivers directly. | Use ASCOM Alpaca/ASCOM Remote, INDI, or another supported backend. | No. | Track in `docs/production-readiness/feature-parity-matrix.md` and platform-capability verification. |
| Hardware/platform | Native DSLR control for Canon/Nikon is not a public-release guarantee. | DSLR users may need an external driver/backend. | Use supported ASCOM, INDI, or Alpaca workflows where available. | No, if docs and release notes do not advertise native DSLR support. | Track in `docs/supported-hardware-by-platform.md` and release notes scope review. |
| Hardware/platform | INDI weather and switch parity is not fully verified for release-critical safety. | Linux/macOS observatory safety may require another backend. | Use a verified Alpaca or ASCOM safety/weather path for unattended operation. | Yes for unattended safety claims unless verified. | Track in hardware smoke evidence and `docs/production-readiness/feature-parity-matrix.md`. |
| Remote/headless | Fully-unattended **headless** acquisition on real ASCOM hardware is still being hardened: headless COM-session issues affect mount connect, filter-wheel set, mid-session camera stability, and the sequence start-gate (B1–B6, B18, B19). | Unattended *headless* nights on a Windows ASCOM rig may stall or mis-capture; the desktop GUI path performs the same operations correctly. | Use the desktop app for unattended runs, or supervise headless nights. Remote monitoring and planning over the LAN are reliable. | Yes for an *unattended-headless* acquisition claim; No for monitoring/planning and the desktop scope. | Tracked in `docs/release-evidence/5.0.0.md` and GitHub issues [#1–#6](https://github.com/Scdouglas1999/Nightshade/issues?q=label%3Abeta-gap). |
| Remote/headless | Scoped tokens are coarse-grained (`view`, `control`, `admin`) rather than custom per-route roles. | Operators cannot yet define custom roles for a specific device or workflow. | Issue separate view/control/admin tokens and keep admin tokens limited to trusted operators. | No, if coarse scopes meet the release security model. | Track in Remote Access and Security sections of `docs/production-readiness/public-release-master-checklist.md`. |
| Living Sky | Constellation is self-hosted; Nightshade operates no public/default hub in 5.0. | Users cannot join a global swarm without choosing an operator they trust. | Run `server/nightshade_hub` or use a trusted club/operator hub and enter its URL. | No; this is the explicit 5.0 deployment model. | Hub README and dedicated CI job. |
| Living Sky | New Living Sky native processing and automation paths have automated coverage but no final physical-rig/on-sky soak. | Timing, device, or data-quality behavior may differ on a real rig. | Run a supervised complete night before relying on it unattended. | Yes for unattended claims; no for supervised beta scope. | 5.0 release evidence and hardware campaign. |
| Desktop mirroring | Master/slave mirroring is contract- and local-stack tested, not yet soaked across two physical machines on a real LAN. | Network/firewall and long-session behavior may reveal gaps. | Validate host discovery/manual URL, reconnect, monitoring, and one control cycle on your LAN before depending on it. | No for beta; yes for a fully verified mirroring claim. | 5.0 release evidence. |
| Updates | Official 5.0.0 artifacts are manual-update-only; no updater executable, trusted update key, or update server is shipped. | The app does not install the next release automatically. | Back up, download/verify the next GitHub release, and replace the portable bundle. | No; OTA is removed from public 5.0 scope and fails closed. | Release workflow and `docs/OTA_UPDATE_TESTING.md`. |
| Distribution | Windows is unsigned and Android is debug-signed. | SmartScreen/Android install warnings appear; no managed/store update path exists. | Verify SHA-256/GitHub source and follow the installation guide. | No for public beta; yes for a production/store distribution claim. | Release notes and installation guide. |
| Cloud backup | S3-compatible backup is tested against an in-process object store, not every live S3/MinIO/B2 variant. | Endpoint-specific signing or policy differences may fail. | Test connection and perform a disposable backup/restore before relying on it. | No for beta with this warning. | S3 tests and 5.0 release evidence. |

## Unsupported By Platform

Platform-specific unsupported items must match the Platform Capabilities UI,
`/api/info.platformCapabilities`, and
`docs/production-readiness/feature-parity-matrix.md`.

| Feature/backend | Windows | Linux | macOS | User-facing reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASCOM COM | Available | Unsupported | Unsupported | Requires Windows COM and locally installed ASCOM drivers. |
| ASCOM Alpaca | Available | Available | Available | Network backend; device-specific capability gaps are reported by the Alpaca server. |
| INDI | Available | Available | Available | Requires a reachable INDI server and driver support for the device capability. |
| Native SDK | Capability-gated | Capability-gated | Capability-gated | Requires user-installed vendor SDK libraries and supported OS drivers; official archives do not redistribute them. |
| Simulator | Capability-gated | Capability-gated | Capability-gated | Workflow-specific; use ASCOM, Alpaca, or INDI simulator drivers for hardware-like smoke tests unless an in-app simulator path is explicitly enabled. |

## Release Notes Checklist

Before publishing release notes, verify that each accepted limitation has:

- matching wording in release notes
- a support-matrix entry if hardware/platform related
- an in-app disabled state or explicit error path where applicable
- a troubleshooting or setup doc link when users can self-correct
- a tracking issue or owner for follow-up
