# Wave C3 — mechanical file splits — batch `app-screens`

Scope: `packages/nightshade_app/lib/screens/**`, threshold 1000 lines (Dart).

## Result

At HEAD, 44 non-generated files under `screens/` were ≥ 1000 lines.
**After this batch: 0.** Largest remaining file under `screens/` is
`mosaic/mosaic_project_screen.dart` at 991 lines (already under threshold at HEAD,
not touched).

`dart analyze` on `packages/nightshade_app`: **0 errors, 0 warnings** (74 `info`
diagnostics, all pre-existing `deprecated_member_use` / one doc-comment info,
none introduced by this batch — they are the same diagnostics on the same code,
relocated).

Tests: `flutter test --exclude-tags golden` in `packages/nightshade_app` —
**3301 passed, 0 failed**. That is the exact command `melos run test` issues
(`melos.yaml:318`). No test file was edited; not even an import line needed
changing, because parts inherit the parent library's imports.

A bare `flutter test` (no tag filter) is *not* the gate and does not pass at HEAD
either: `test/screens/analytics/captures_landscape_test.dart` is `@Tags(['golden'])`,
hangs for its full 10-minute timeout, and then poisons every subsequent test in the
shard with `'!inTest': is not true` — 2 real failures plus a 40-test cascade. That
file is excluded by `--exclude-tags golden` by design (`packages/nightshade_app/dart_test.yaml`,
`docs/testing/golden-tests.md`). Confirmed unrelated to this batch: the cascade
victims (`test/widgets/**`, 289 tests) all pass when run as their own directory.

## Mechanism

Every split is a verbatim line-range move into a Dart `part` file, following the
convention already used in this package
(`planner_screen.dart` → `planner_screen_parts/*.dart`,
`science_analytics_tab.dart` → `science_analytics_tab/*.dart`).

Each part file opens with

```dart
// Part of ../<parent>.dart -- extracted for maintainability.
//
// <one line saying what lives here>
part of '../<parent>.dart';
```

Because parts share the library scope, **no import changed, no symbol was renamed,
and no member visibility was widened**. Private classes, private members and
library-private top-level functions stay exactly as visible as they were.

Three shapes were used:

1. **Top-level declarations** (most files): whole `class` / `enum` / `typedef` /
   provider / function declarations moved verbatim.
2. **Members of one giant `State` / `StateNotifier` class**: moved into
   `extension _X on _FooState { ... }` inside the part file — the idiom already
   present at `planetarium_screen/actions.dart:3` and
   `connected_device_card/dialogs_and_settings.dart:3`.
3. **Members of a mixin** (guiding screen only): moved into a sibling `mixin`,
   the idiom already present at `guiding_screen_parts/mobile_sections.dart:6`.

## Recorded deviations from a pure verbatim move

These are the only edits outside "cut lines, paste lines, add `part` directive":

| Where | Edit | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 14 new extension part files | added `// ignore_for_file: invalid_use_of_protected_member` (and, for the two `StateNotifier` parts, `invalid_use_of_visible_for_testing_member`) | `setState` / `StateNotifier.state` are `@protected`; the analyzer does not treat an extension as "inside the class" even in the same library. This is the repo's existing answer to the same problem — see `equipment/dialogs/profile_editor_dialog/*.dart:1`, four files that already carry this exact ignore for this exact reason. |
| `guiding/guiding_screen_parts/desktop_sections.dart:7` | `on ConsumerState<GuidingScreen>, _GuidingStateFields` → `..., _GuidingActions` | the extracted mixin must be a superclass constraint so the remaining desktop builders can still call the moved helpers |
| `guiding/guiding_screen.dart:52` | added `_GuidingActions,` to the `with` clause, before `_GuidingDesktopSections` | apply the new mixin; ordering matches the existing `_GuidingStateFields` → `_GuidingDesktopSections` → `_GuidingMobileSections` chain |

No logic edits, no renames, no signature changes, no test edits.

## Constraints discovered (they shaped several split boundaries)

Four Dart rules forced some members to stay in the parent class. Each was found by
`dart analyze`, not by guessing:

1. **`static` members cannot move into an extension** — a `static` member of an
   extension must always be qualified, so both moved and unmoved call sites break.
   Statics stayed in the class, and any method that referenced a static
   *unqualified* stayed with them.
   - `session_review_controller.dart`: `_filterMatches`, `_safeName`,
     `_suffixBeforeExtension`, `_swapExtension` and `_integrate`,
     `_loadDefaultSettings` stayed.
   - `science_export_hub.dart`: `_buildSessionFilter` stayed.
   - `centering_dialog.dart`: `_buildStatusSection` stayed (`_formatRa`/`_formatDec`).
2. **Two extensions on the same type cannot see each other's private members.**
   All private helpers of one class therefore go into *one* extension.
3. **Extensions cannot declare instance fields** — `mosaic_wizard_dialog.dart`'s
   `_cachedGeometry` / `_cachedGeometryKey` stayed in the class.
4. **`@override` members cannot move** (`super` is illegal in an extension) —
   `dispose` stayed in `_QuickStartWizardDialogState`.

(Line counts above are pre-`dart format`; the formatter changed 14 files by a line
or two of blank-line normalisation.)

## Out of scope / untouched
- `localization/nightshade_localizations/translations.dart` (1486) — map report
  `app-screens-b` §1.2 lists it, but it is under `lib/localization/`, not
  `lib/screens/`, so it belongs to another batch.
- Headless API handlers — belong to the `apps-shells` batch.
- No generated file, FRB binding or pending-deletion file was touched.
