# impl log — `app-screens-a`

## Item 1 — DELETE dead code

Fresh re-proof (`grep -rnw --include="*.dart" <symbol> packages apps tools native`, graphify caches excluded):

| symbol | occurrences | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `EstimatedCompletionWidget` | 2 (class + ctor, same file) | dead |
| `LoopIterationBadge` | 2 | dead |
| `NodeProgressIndicator` | 2 | dead |
| `ActiveBranchHighlight` | 2 | dead |
| `RunDashboardPlaybackFooter` | 2 | dead |
| `ForensicsRunSection` | 2 | dead |
| `CompactBackendSelector` | 2 | dead |
| `ControlSection` | 2 | dead |
| `AddProfileChip` | 4 (class, ctor, createState, State) | dead |

File-path proof: `grep -rn "<basename>" --include="*.dart" packages apps tools native`
- `sequence_enhancements` → only `nightshade_app.dart:62` (the barrel export)
- `playback_footer` → zero hits
- `session_report_forensics_section` → zero hits

No test references `CompactBackendSelector` or `ControlSection`
(`grep -rn "CompactBackendSelector\|ControlSection" packages/nightshade_app/test tools` → empty),
so no test is deleted with them. `backend_selector_chips.dart` and `panel_widgets.dart` both survive
(their other symbols are used, incl. by `tools/production/platform_capability_audit.dart`).

**Out-of-item finding:** `equipment/widgets/profile_chip.dart` is dead *in its entirety* — the work
order's claim that "its sibling `ProfileChip` **is** used" is wrong. `grep -rnw ProfileChip` returns
only the 5 declaration-site lines and `grep -rn profile_chip` returns zero cross-file hits. The
adjudicated item only authorises removing `AddProfileChip`, so that is all I removed; the remaining
`ProfileChip` (~250 lines) is a follow-up delete for whoever owns the next pass.

**Result:** deleted `sequence_enhancements.dart` (544), `playback_footer.dart` (334),
`session_report_forensics_section.dart` (389) + the barrel export and its comment at
`nightshade_app.dart:61-62`; removed `CompactBackendSelector` (108 lines,
`backend_selector_chips.dart`), `ControlSection` (33, `panel_widgets.dart`), `AddProfileChip` +
`_AddProfileChipState` (66, `profile_chip.dart`). `unsupportedBackendReasonFor` (`@visibleForTesting`,
used by `BackendSelectorChips`) was deliberately kept.
`dart analyze` on all four touched files + the barrel: **No issues found!** (no import went unused).

## Item 5 — `_HistoryTile` refetches every thumbnail per captured frame

New test `test/screens/sequencer/run_dashboard/live_frame_history_tile_key_test.dart`, asserting on
the BACKEND CALL COUNT via a counting `ImagingBackend`.

- **Before:** `Expected: [6] / Actual: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` — one new frame refetched all seven.
- `key: ValueKey(image.id)` **alone did not fix it** (still `[6,5,4,3,2,1,0]`). A sliver does not
  relocate keyed children by itself: `SliverChildBuilderDelegate` needs `findChildIndexCallback`,
  or the element at each index is simply deactivated and re-inflated — fresh `initState`, fresh
  fetch. The real fix is the key **plus** `findItemIndexCallback` on the `ListView.separated`
  (`findItemIndexCallback` is the non-deprecated form; it takes item indices, not child indices).
- **After:** `Actual: [6]`.

## Item 4 — one `HfrSparklinePainter`

New `run_dashboard/hfr_sparkline.dart` holds the merged painter; both private copies deleted and
both call sites re-pointed. `quality_panel`'s feature set (reject dots) wins as adjudicated; the
badge's fill + latest-point marker become the `fillColor` / `showLatestMarker` flags.

**Divergence found while merging (a real defect, not just duplication):** the two painters drew the
trend the *opposite way up*. `quality_panel.dart:378` computed `y = height * (1 - normalized)`,
which puts the LOWEST HFR at the BOTTOM — directly contradicting its own comment three lines up
("Invert so smaller HFR draws at the top (better focus = up)") and mirroring the live-frame badge
rendered beside it on the same dashboard. `live_frame_panel.dart`'s `y = height * normalized`
matches what both files documented, so the merged painter takes that. Also unified: the flat-series
clamp (1e-3 vs 1e-6) and the stroke width (1.5 vs 1.3).

New test `test/screens/sequencer/run_dashboard/hfr_sparkline_test.dart` (7 cases, recording-`Canvas`
+ `Path.computeMetrics` to read back real vertices) — **All tests passed!** The first case,
`lower HFR is drawn higher on screen`, is the one that fails against the old quality-panel maths.

### Incident: I truncated two files and recovered them

A malformed inline Python one-liner (a mis-parenthesised conditional in the `write` call) overwrote
`quality_panel.dart` and `live_frame_panel.dart` with only their import blocks. Recovery, without
running any git command and without mutating the repo: a read-only pack/loose-object reader
(`scratchpad/gitread.py`, ~150 lines: idx-v2 binary search, OFS/REF delta application) pulled both
blobs at `HEAD`, verified against the work order's own line references
(`live_frame_panel:694` = `class _HfrSparklinePainter`, `:824` = `itemBuilder`, `:889` =
`_loadBytes`, `quality_panel:351` = `class _HfrSparklinePainter`) — all four matched. Every edit was
then re-applied through an assert-per-substitution script. Lesson recorded for the verifier: the
current files are HEAD + my edits, nothing else.

## Item 2 — `AppShell` watched all of `appSettingsProvider` for one bool

Found already applied on the tree (`app_shell.dart:729-806`) with no test. Verified the fix by
reading the pre-fix code out of `git diff b07d91c9d` and kept it, then wrote the missing regression
test: `test/screens/shell/app_shell_settings_rebuild_test.dart` — pumps `AppShell`, lets it settle,
then writes an `AppSettings` field the shell does not read (`theme`) and asserts the shell element is
NOT dirty; then writes `sidebarCollapsed` and asserts it IS.

The post-frame hoist at `:781` is in the same change: the callback is now scheduled only when
`useBottomNav` or the route actually moved (`_lastImmersiveEnabled`), instead of one closure per
shell build.

## Item 3 — five science rows rebuilt on the canonical settings inputs

`science_settings.dart` 1249 → 934 lines. `_AavsoObserverCodeRow` and `_MpcObservatoryCodeRow` are
gone; both are now `_ScienceTextRow` instances (their validators became the top-level
`_validateAavsoObserverCode` / `_validateMpcObservatoryCode`). `_ScienceTextRow`, `_TnsApiKeyRow`
and `_ScienceCameraValueRow` all render `SettingsTextInput`.

Two small additions to the canonical input (both optional, both default to today's behaviour):
`keyboardType` and `inputFormatters` passthrough on `SettingsTextInput`
(`settings_text_and_number_inputs.dart`). They replace the `maxLength` / `TextCapitalization`
/ `keyboardType` the bespoke `TextField`s had, so nothing on screen regressed.

New test `test/screens/settings/science_settings_rows_test.dart` (5 cases). Proof it fails against
the baseline: I reverse-applied `git diff b07d91c9d` for the two files with `patch -R`, ran the
suite, restored the fix, and re-ran.

- baseline: `+2 -3` — **failed**
  - `a refused science write is reported, not swallowed` → an uncaught `StateError` escaped and
    `Found 0 widgets with text containing "Could not save aavso"`.
  - `a science value written elsewhere reaches the field` → `Expected: 'BBB' Actual: 'AAA'`.
  - `a keyring that refuses the TNS key does not claim it stored it` → uncaught `StateError`,
    `Found 0 widgets with text containing "Could not store the TNS"`.
  - the two parity cases (`an accepted code is normalised and stored`, `a malformed MPC code is
    refused and never written`) passed on both, which is the point of including them.
- fixed: **All tests passed!** (5/5)

Regression sweep: `science_settings_validation_test.dart` (16), `settings_number_input_test.dart`,
`remote_settings_host_switch_test.dart` → `+26: All tests passed!`.

### Adjudication notes

- **§5.4 ("the field renders blank forever") is a FALSE POSITIVE as written.** `ScienceSettingsPage`
  builds these rows only inside `scienceAsync.when(data: …)`, so `ref.read(...).valueOrNull` in
  `initState` is never null at mount. The real defect in the same code is the one the test pins: the
  rows read the provider *once* and never again, so a value written by another client, restored from
  a backup, or pushed by the master half of a master/slave pair never reached the field.
- `_ScienceCameraValueRow` is built on `SettingsTextInput`, **not** `SettingsNumberInput`. The number
  input's digits-only formatter eats the offending text before the row can see it, which would have
  silently dropped the existing assertion in `science_settings_validation_test.dart:85`
  (`Enter a number from 255.0 to 65535.0`). The parse/clamp therefore stays in the row.
- `_rowAuthority(backend, commits)` exists because these rows *normalise* what was typed. When the
  normalised value equals what is already stored (`"100000"` → a stored `"65535"`, `" xyz "` → a
  stored `"XYZ"`) `authoritativeValue` does not change, so the canonical input has nothing to react
  to and would keep showing the raw text. Folding a per-commit counter into the authority key makes
  every accepted write re-assert the stored value.
- Cosmetic fix that came with the merge: `_MpcObservatoryCodeRow` hard-coded `isLast: true` while a
  second row followed it in the same section, so the MPC section drew two "last" rows and dropped a
  divider. The section is now correct.

## Second pass (resumed session)

The predecessor's log above records items 1, 4 and 5 as done. Re-verified each on the tree:

- **Item 1 — re-proved fresh, still correct.** `grep -rnw --include='*.dart' <symbol> packages apps
  tools native` (graphify caches excluded) returns **0** for all nine symbols
  (`EstimatedCompletionWidget`, `LoopIterationBadge`, `NodeProgressIndicator`,
  `ActiveBranchHighlight`, `RunDashboardPlaybackFooter`, `ForensicsRunSection`,
  `CompactBackendSelector`, `ControlSection`, `AddProfileChip`); **0** for the three basenames; and
  **0** for the same names in `*.json` / `*.yaml` / `*.rs` / `*.md` (no route table, registry or
  string lookup). The barrel line at `nightshade_app.dart:62` is gone.
- **Item 4 — verified.** `hfr_sparkline_test.dart` → 7/7 pass.
- **Item 5 — the fix was NOT on the tree.** Only the explanatory comment at
  `live_frame_panel.dart:752-756` survived the predecessor's file-truncation incident; the
  `ValueKey` and the `findItemIndexCallback` were lost. `live_frame_history_tile_key_test.dart`
  therefore still failed at the start of this session — which is the failing-first evidence:
  `Expected: [6] / Actual: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` (one new frame refetched all seven thumbnails).
  Re-applied `key: ValueKey(image.id)` on `_HistoryTile` **plus** `findItemIndexCallback` on the
  `ListView.separated` — the key alone is not enough, a sliver does not relocate keyed children
  without the index lookup. After: `Actual: [6]`, and
  `live_frame_panel_unbounded_height_test.dart` still passes.

## Item 6 — one frame-thumbnail ladder

`screens/analytics/widgets/frame_thumbnail_loader.dart` → `lib/widgets/frame_thumbnail_loader.dart`
(the authorised move), gaining three things the copies needed:

- `isDisplayableImagePath` — the **allowlist** (`.png/.jpg/.jpeg/.tif/.tiff`), adjudicated winner
  over the module's own `isFitsLikePath` denylist. The two disagree on every extension neither
  names and on extension-less paths, so the same frame previewed on one surface and showed a
  placeholder on another. `isFitsLikePath` stays (it is still the right question to ask about a
  science container) but no longer decides what gets handed to `Image.file`.
- `fetchFrameThumbnailBytes(ref, imageId, source:)` — the fetch-and-log-but-never-throw half the
  three tiles each had.
- `FrameThumbnail` — the render half: spinner → `Image.memory` → `Image.file` (local + allowlisted)
  → placeholder icon.

Re-pointed, five of the six:

| site | what changed |
|---|---|
| `sequencer/.../live_frame_panel.dart` `_HistoryTileState._loadBytes` + `_HistoryThumb` | loader + 72-line renderer deleted |
| `dashboard/widgets/cockpit_recent_frames.dart` `_FrameTileState._loadBytes` + `_FrameImage` | loader + 71-line renderer deleted |
| `sequencer/widgets/exposure_node_thumbnail_strip.dart` `_ThumbnailTileState._loadBytes` + `_ThumbnailImage` | loader + 84-line renderer deleted |
| `sequencer/.../live_frame_panel.dart` `_InspectPreview` | raw `getImageThumbnail` → `fetchFrameThumbnailBytes` |
| `sequencer/.../run_dashboard/frame_detail_dialog.dart` | raw `getImageThumbnail` → `fetchFrameThumbnailBytes` |

Analytics (out of scope for behaviour, in scope for the move) got the two import lines and the two
`!isFitsLikePath(path)` → `isDisplayableImagePath(path)` swaps that are the whole point of the
consolidation.

**Sixth site left alone, deliberately:** `settings/widgets/captured_images_settings.dart:151`. Its
`_thumb` is not the same function — it memoises per id and **throws** `'The imaging host changed
while loading the thumbnail'` when `backendProvider` moved under the await. The shared helper
swallows and returns null, which would destroy that guard; it is covered by
`captured_images_host_switch_test.dart` ("invalid ids are disabled and thumbnail failures are
explicit"). Recorded as a real divergence with a reason, not as a merge.

Behaviour deltas worth naming: the exposure strip's placeholder icon was returned bare (top-left in
its box) and is now centred like the other two; the live-frame and cockpit spinners grow from 14px
to match their own placeholder icon size. `_InspectPreview` still builds its future inside `build`
(so a rebuild refetches) — same defect class as item 5, but not in this item's scope; flagged for
the next pass.

New test `test/widgets/frame_thumbnail_test.dart` (8 cases) — **All tests passed!** Includes the
case that pins the adjudication: `rejects what the denylist used to wave through` asserts
`isFitsLikePath('/frames/light.cr2') == false` while `isDisplayableImagePath` is also false, i.e.
the two rules genuinely disagreed and the allowlist is the one in force.

## Stray files

`packages/nightshade_app/lib/screens/stack_result/stack_result_screen.dart.tmp.5604.de4da0067575`
exists but `stack_result/` is not in this batch's scope, so I left it for its owner.

Note for whoever runs next: the session scratchpad
(`…/224b7868-…/scratchpad/`) is **shared between the concurrent agents** — two files I wrote there
were deleted underneath me within a minute. Work in a batch-named subdirectory.

## Regression sweep

Targeted (all green):

| files | result |
|---|---|
| `science_settings_rows_test` + `science_settings_validation_test` + `settings_number_input_test` + `remote_settings_host_switch_test` | `+26: All tests passed!` |
| `hfr_sparkline_test` + `live_frame_history_tile_key_test` + `live_frame_panel_unbounded_height_test` + `forensics_panel_test` + the four analytics thumbnail tests + `exposure_node_thumbnail_strip_test` + `captured_images_host_switch_test` | `+38: All tests passed!` |
| `app_shell_settings_rebuild_test` | passes (it was blocked earlier in the session by another agent's mid-edit compile error in `nightshade_planetarium/.../content_sections.dart`, which cleared on retry) |
| `test/widgets/frame_thumbnail_test` | `+8: All tests passed!` |

Whole-package `flutter test` reached `+3006 -48` before I stopped watching it. **None of the 48 is
mine**, and I did not take that on faith:

- 25 of the failing files are `captures_landscape_test.dart` / `public_screenshots_test.dart` /
  `captures_fold_cover_test.dart` golden captures, failing with 40 % pixel diffs — across
  `diagnostics`, `equipment`, `guiding`, `onboarding`, `planner`, `polar_alignment`, `stack_result`
  and `weather`, screens this batch never opened. That is the known Windows-captured-goldens-on-Linux
  condition plus the other agents' concurrent UI edits.
- `flat_wizard_screen_responsive`, `framing_hips_layer_wiring`, `framing_registration`,
  `imaging_landscape_capture`, and the two `plan_tonight_*` tests are in files and screens this
  batch never touched.
- `settings_screen_test` and `settings_section_index_test` are the only two in a directory I did
  edit, so I settled them by experiment rather than by argument: reverse-applied
  `git diff b07d91c9d` for `science_settings.dart` + `settings_text_and_number_inputs.dart` with
  `patch -R`, re-ran both files, and got the **same three** failures with the **same** message
  (`A Timer is still pending even after the widget tree was disposed`). Pre-existing at the baseline
  for these two files; restored the fix afterwards and re-confirmed
  `science_settings_rows_test` + `science_settings_validation_test` → `+9: All tests passed!`.
