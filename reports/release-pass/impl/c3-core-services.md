# Wave C3 — batch `core-services`

Scope: `packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/services/**` files over 1000 lines at HEAD
(`sequence_executor.dart` belongs to `core-providers` and was not touched).

Plans followed: `reports/release-pass/map/core-services-devices.md` §1 and
`reports/release-pass/map/core-services-rest.md` §1, re-measured at HEAD before cutting.

## Mechanism actually used, and why it differs from the map in two places

The map plans propose two mechanisms: `part`/`part of`, and "plain sibling library +
re-export". Everything below uses **`part`/`part of` only**. A `part` file is the same
Dart library as its parent, so no import anywhere changes, nothing needs re-exporting,
and privacy is preserved exactly. Directory naming follows the convention already in the
tree (`<parent_basename>/…`, as in `smart_night_service/`, `imaging_service/`,
`scheduler/scheduler_engine/`), not the shorter directory names the map sketches.

Two constraints shaped every cut and are the reason some parents stayed above 1000:

1. **Only private instance members move into an `extension`.** The established idiom in
   this repo (`providers/sequence/sequence_executor/*_operations.dart`,
   `science_processing_service/private_helpers.dart`) is
   `part of '../x.dart';` + `extension _XSomething on X { … }` holding **private**
   methods. Moving a *public* method into an extension is **not** behaviour-preserving:
   extension members are statically dispatched, are invisible to `dynamic` receivers,
   and are not intercepted by `Mock`/`noSuchMethod` subclasses. A first attempt on
   `sky_atlas_service.dart` moved public methods and the analyzer immediately reported
   them as unreferenced (a private extension does not export them); that attempt was
   restored from HEAD and redone with private members only.
2. **`@override` members and instance fields cannot move at all** — an extension cannot
   satisfy an interface and cannot declare state.

Where a moved private method called a private **static** of the same class, one of two
mechanical fixes was applied, both behaviour-identical:

* the static was promoted to a library-private top-level function in a `part` file
  (identifier unchanged, so *every* call site — inside and outside the moved code —
  still resolves textually unchanged); or
* the reference was qualified with `ClassName.` where promotion was not warranted.

**Recorded visibility changes:** none. No symbol became more or less visible outside its
library. The static→top-level promotions keep the leading `_`, i.e. library-private
before and after.

## Trap found and fixed during this batch

The auto-qualifier inserted `ClassName.` at analyzer-reported offsets, and three of those
offsets were inside a `'$identifier'` string interpolation, silently turning
`'… LIMIT $_dumpPageSize …'` into `'… LIMIT $BackupService._dumpPageSize …'` — i.e. a
*text* change to a SQL statement, not a qualification. It was caught by
`backup_service_archive_stream_test.dart`. All three were converted to `${…}`:

* `backup_service/table_registry.dart:143`
* `backup_service/restore_validation.dart:60`
* `centering_service/slew_settle.dart:40`

Every remaining inserted qualification was then re-read individually; all are in ordinary
code positions.

`run()` in `stack_and_share_service.dart` was deliberately left whole, as the map
instructs. `_capture` in `imaging_service.dart` and `_processFrame` in
`science_processing_service.dart` were moved **verbatim** rather than decomposed — the
map's decomposition of those two into staged sub-methods is a logic refactor, out of
scope for a mechanical split.

### Not split

* **`science/default_science_backend.dart` (1060).** Every member of the class is an
  `@override` of `ScienceBackend`. An extension cannot carry an interface implementation,
  and a mixin extraction would need `mixin M on DefaultScienceBackend` while the class
  declares `with M` — circular. The map's "all `part`" plan for this file does not
  compile. Splitting it needs the class restructured, which is not mechanical.

### Split, but still over 1000

* **`flat_wizard_service.dart` → 1169.** The residue is public API:
  `resolveCaptureConfig` (153, a `static` called as `FlatWizardService.resolveCaptureConfig`
  from `flat_wizard_provider.dart` and a test — the map flags this constraint too),
  `exposeAndAwait` (221), `calibrateFilter` (204), `calibrateFilterWithRateTracking` (201),
  `calibrateMultipleFilters`, `generateFlatSequence`, `generateCompleteSequence`,
  `quickCalibrate`, `captureTestFrame`.
* **`constellation/constellation_service.dart` → 1085.** Residue is again public:
  `contributeTarget` (201), `contributeRawSubs` (122), `pullTarget` (120),
  `followTheNight` (103), `sweepSwarmBlobs` (101).

Both would come down with a forwarder pattern (public stub in the class delegating to a
private extension method), but that invents new symbols rather than moving code, so it
was left for an explicit decision.

## Verification

* `dart analyze lib` in `packages/nightshade_core` — **No issues found**.
* `flutter test` (whole package, JSON reporter): **667 suites / 7217 tests, all success**,
  `"success": true`. No test file was edited — not even an import line; `part` files
  share the parent's library, so no import anywhere in the repo changed.
* `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed` over exactly the touched files — clean.
* Audited every `extension` created: all are `_`-prefixed and contain only `_`-prefixed
  members, so nothing left the class's exported surface.
