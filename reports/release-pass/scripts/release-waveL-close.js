    `You are the live SMOKE check of the Nightshade release pass (Wave L), confirming the K-response batch (origin-threaded stop + run-id on Stopped + FRB regeneration) did not regress the working surface. Drive the fresh bundle at apps/desktop/build/linux/x64/release/bundle/nightshade_desktop via tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py (profile AFTER subcommand; the AT-SPI tree lags — re-dump before judging; fresh profile opens onboarding: Skip by image coordinates if the tree lacks geometry). One graphify query first. Verify with evidence:
1. The app STARTS and reaches the dashboard (the FRB regeneration touched every API family — a wire-format mismatch would fail fast). Connect sim devices; confirm device status renders.
2. Run a short sim sequence to completion — frames captured, tally correct, session report opens. This exercises the regenerated event stream end-to-end.
3. Press Stop on a second run → exactly ONE "Sequence stopped" row with "Stopped by request", no regression.
4. Scan the a11y tree on dashboard + run dashboard + equipment for error widgets/overflow after all of the above.

    `You are the FINAL refuter of the Nightshade release pass (Wave L). One graphify query first. Attack the newest commit (git log --oneline -3; the K-response) with adjacent counter-inputs at HEAD (throwaway tests in an untracked dir, deleted after; no repo edits). Under attack:
(a) origin threading: enumerate EVERY caller chain into SequenceExecutor.stop and api_sequencer_stop (Dart and Rust, including headless handlers and recovery paths) and verify each carries the honest origin — is there any non-operator path still defaulting to operator evidence? Does the stopFailed RETRY preserve the original origin (a scheduler stop that fails and is re-driven must not become an operator stop)?
(b) run-id identity in the fold (run_dashboard_providers.dart): a Stopped with runId joining an id-LESS group of a different run; two same-run groups forced apart by kind capacity then a neutral Stopped choosing between them; the id-less fallback's pairwise chaining absorbing beyond the bound via stepping-stone members — is that acceptable?
(c) the Rust side: stop_with_origin's scheduler branch emits "Autopilot: stop" as SystemEvent — check it respects decision_logging_enabled, that the ManualIntervention path is unchanged for None/operator, and that active_sequence_run_id is read BEFORE stop clears it in api_sequencer_stop (is it cleared? verify).
(d) the FRB regeneration fallout: stale re-export shims (event.dart, device_capabilities.dart, api_barrel) — any type-identity split remaining (two NightshadeEvent types reachable)? Any Dart consumer still importing a deleted monolith path?
(e) the suite D1-D16: tautologies or producer-set infidelity.
Be proportionate: file only findings an operator would notice or a maintainer must know; P4 nits in notes. Return ONLY the structured result with role='refuter', verified=holds, failed=refuted-with-evidence.`,
