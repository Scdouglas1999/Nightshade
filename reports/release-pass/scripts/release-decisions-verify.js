    `You are the live DRIVER verifying the owner-decision implementations (see "Owner decisions (made 2026-08-14...)" in reports/release-pass/RELEASE-PASS-2026-08-11.md). Drive the fresh bundle at apps/desktop/build/linux/x64/release/bundle/nightshade_desktop via tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py (profile AFTER subcommand; the AT-SPI tree lags — re-dump before judging; fresh profile opens onboarding: Skip by image coordinates if the tree lacks geometry). One graphify query first. Verify with evidence:
1. AUTOPILOT PAUSE (decision 1): dispatch a run via the autopilot/scheduler with sim devices, press Stop → the autopilot does NOT re-dispatch (~44s wait), and a visible "Autopilot paused — resume?" affordance appears; Resume restores dispatching.
2. REMOVAL = INELIGIBLE (decision 3): remove a target from the scheduler → the autopilot never picks it afterwards (watch at least one evaluation cycle).
3. IMG-9 (decision 9): loop exposures on the imaging screen → the Frame Count label counts loop frames and resets on a new loop.
4. CON-56: the time control panel reads "Now"/"Tonight", not ALL-CAPS.
5. Regressions: a normal sequence still runs to completion; one press of Stop still yields ONE honest feed row; dashboard + run dashboard a11y scans clean.

    `You are the REFUTER of the owner-decision implementations (newest commit; the decisions list is in reports/release-pass/RELEASE-PASS-2026-08-11.md "Owner decisions"). One graphify query first. Throwaway tests in an untracked dir, deleted after; no repo edits. Attack each implementation with adjacent counter-inputs:
(1) autopilot pause: does the engine distinguish ITS OWN stop (origin scheduler) from the operator's — i.e. does a scheduler-initiated stop wrongly pause the autopilot? Does pause survive a rebuild/restart of the engine? Can a paused engine still be resumed after the run that triggered the pause is long gone?
(2) pushes: feed each producer set (operator press / Autopilot: stop / System: stop origins / bare safety abort) through the classifier+router — exactly the non-operator ones push, at NORMAL priority (accepted adjudication: the app has no 'info' push tier — sequenceCompleted's tier is the correct one; do NOT refute on priority naming), one push per episode, honest copy?
(3) removal-ineligible: is the ineligibility persisted, and can a re-added target become eligible again? Does 'Clear all' behave the same as per-target removal?
(4) unpark gating: a parked mount unparks; an unparked mount is a no-op; what does a mount that cannot report park state do?
(5) deletions: does anything still import the deleted files (analyzer across every package)? Did the bridge_stub policy comment get corrected?
(6) mosaic sink: is SessionWizardCheckpointSink REALLY the production wiring now (read the provider, not the docs), and do the resume tests exercise that wiring?
(7) fits-master: a stack save without per-frame headers → valid FITS, synthesized EXPTIME = total integration, DATE-OBS = first frame; does a NORMAL sequenced save still carry its real headers?
(8) AF-fail policy: non-convergence restores the pre-AF position and continues with a decision row; an EXPLICIT AF node's configured failure_action is untouched.
(9) IMG-9 reset semantics; (10) CON-62 search index regenerated and the search test green.
Be proportionate. Return ONLY the structured result with role='refuter', verified=holds, failed=refuted-with-evidence.`,
