const CHARTER = `You are closing the Wave G refutations in the Nightshade release pass. Tree GREEN at HEAD. Your evidence is reports/release-pass/waveG-result.json — the refuter's entries name exact files, lines, wire paths, and provide throwaway tests under /tmp/claude-1000/.../scratchpad/ that you MUST adopt into the repo as the failing tests. The G drivers' entries carry live screenshots and repro traps (e.g. the WD-EQ-3 second toast lands between 3s and 5s — a short-wait check reads as fixed). One graphify query first. Failing test FIRST, encoding the refuter's exact counter-input (the REAL wire shape, not a convenient one). NO GUI harness, NO bundle rebuilds, NO git writes, NO melos, NO repo-wide formatters, NO generated files, NO FRB regen unless an item explicitly weighs it (then stop + record blocked with the exact delta). Log to reports/release-pass/impl/gfix-<batch>.md. Final message: ONLY the structured result.`
