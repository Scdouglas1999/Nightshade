One graphify query first. Verify EXACTLY the assigned D-fix items against their Wave-D evidence (reports/release-pass/waveE-result.json + reports/release-pass/impl/efix-*.md list what was claimed fixed and how); classify verified_fixed / still_broken with evidence. Then ONE adversarial sweep pass of your screens for anything the fixes broke. Report to reports/release-pass/gui/waveF-<cluster>.md. Do not fix anything.`
