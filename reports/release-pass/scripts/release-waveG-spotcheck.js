    `You are the closing spot-check driver for the Nightshade release pass, sequencer half. Drive the FRESH bundle at apps/desktop/build/linux/x64/release/bundle/nightshade_desktop via tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py (profile AFTER subcommand). One graphify query first. Execute EXACTLY these decisive experiments from reports/release-pass/impl/ffix-*.md and report verified/failed per item:
1. WF-STOP-N1: build a Target whose RA sits ON the meridian so the flip trigger fires during frame 1 of a 4x15s burst (the ffix log describes the setup). Oracle: 'select exposure_duration from captured_images order by id desc limit 4' on the profile DB — every light frame must read 15.0; and the flip must still run (log shows it waiting for the in-flight frame then firing).
2. SEQ-18: run a 2-node sequence where node 1 completes (4 frames) and node 2 is stopped at 0. Node 1's card must read '4 / 4 frames' with filled boxes; node 2 '0 / 4'. Check BOTH mid-run after node 1 finishes and after the stop.
3. WF-STOP-N2: the same run's integration must agree across Session Report, Dashboard Last-night card, and Execution History row.
4. One operator stop → exactly ONE stop toast (WF-N4/WF-STOP-N3), no ISO timestamp in the copy (WF-STOP-N5 first half), and the Session Report + banners all tell the stopped story.
5. WF-STOP-N4: if reachable, a retrying meridian flip must not report Running with a past ETA (best-effort; skip if the sim cannot stall a flip).

One graphify query first. Verify per reports/release-pass/impl/ffix-{chrome-polish,sky-science-polish}.md and report verified/failed per item:
1. WD-EQ-2a: disconnect a device — the toast names the device ('Built-in Guider'), not a raw id. WD-EQ-3: the guider double-refusal now collapses to one toast (trailing-punctuation-normalized key).
2. CON-56 (Now/Tonight case), CON-62 (one button treatment + one title case across Help & Tutorials, search still finds renamed rows), WE-EQ-N5 (status-bar cut item has an ellipsis at 1000px), WF-EQ-N1/N2/N3 spot-checks, WE-SP-5 (dashboard prompt no longer hides the Moonrise value at hard bottom-scroll).
3. D-2/WF-SS-N3: the projection cycler tooltip leaves the a11y tree after hover and the control carries an accessible name; time-transport buttons named.
4. WF-SN-N4/WF-SCI-N3: a disabled NightshadeButton now reads DISABLED in the tree (probe Pre-Flight Start Anyway with errors present, and the Pause button under the builtin guider).
5. WF-SCI-N1/N2/N4: Session tab shows the most recent night after a run; Night Doctor verdict updates; Open last run opens the run.
