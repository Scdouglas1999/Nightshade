    `You are the CLOSING live check of the Nightshade release pass (Wave J), verifying the Wave-I response batch. Drive the fresh bundle at apps/desktop/build/linux/x64/release/bundle/nightshade_desktop via tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py (profile AFTER subcommand; the AT-SPI tree lags — re-dump before judging; a fresh profile opens onboarding: Skip it by image coordinates if the tree has no geometry). One graphify query first. Verify, each with pixel/a11y evidence:
1. OPERATOR STOP still reads as one: run a short sim sequence, press Stop once → exactly ONE "Sequence stopped" row, message "Stopped by request" (the evidence source changed to the manual-intervention decision — confirm the message still appears live), no Decision-logged row, earlier rows intact.
2. MEASURED RESERVE at 1000x800: with the next-use ("Skip this step") card showing, scroll to the hard bottom and measure by pixel scan: the last content row must be FULLY readable, and the extent delta vs the no-prompt state must be within a few px of (card height + its 16px inset) — no longer a fixed 210. Then dismiss all steps so the SHORTER Smart Night card shows (enable its auto-prompt if needed): the extent delta must SHRINK to that card's band — the over-reserve is gone. Then dismiss it: delta returns to 0.
3. RESTART-THEN-STOP: run a sequence, stop it, immediately start another run and stop it ~5-10 s after the first stop → the feed shows BOTH runs' stop rows (run boundary honoured) as far as the 5-row budget allows; raise nothing if budget hides one — check the row set right after the second stop.
4. Sanity: two sibling Take Exposures still render two cards.

    `You are the CLOSING refuter of the Nightshade release pass (Wave J). One graphify query first. Attack the newest commit (git log --oneline -3; the I-response: manual-intervention-only evidence + Started-boundary/nearest-group/no-window fold + message-copy in packages/nightshade_app/lib/screens/sequencer/widgets/run_dashboard/run_dashboard_providers.dart; measured-band publish in the two dashboard prompt cards + floatingPromptReservedHeightProvider readers in glass_card.dart/cockpit_standby.dart; microtask dispose release; the rewritten conformance suite recent_events_feed_conformance_test.dart) with adjacent counter-inputs at HEAD (throwaway tests under /tmp only, run from an untracked dir then deleted; no repo edits). Priorities:
(a) fold: a PAUSED run's Stopped-family shape (pause/resume events between producers); a run where the manual-intervention decision arrives but the run then FAILS (does the failure row survive and the stop row stay honest?); history truncation (maxHistorySize) cutting the Started boundary off the tail — does an orphan Stopped join a newer run's group?; two manual-intervention decisions in ONE press (double-emit) — badge or two rows?
(b) measured band: text-scale 1.3 or a narrow window rewrapping the card taller AFTER the first publish — does the band follow (the publish runs per build post-frame; does a pure repaint change height without a rebuild?); the fallback path (no layout yet) — can a stale fallback stick?
(c) the copy-message step: can it overwrite a NON-empty neutral message ever, and can the newest emitted row be a cancel-notice row whose own title differs?
(d) the suite: any case still assertable against the implementation rather than the contract?
