One graphify query first (hook). Your PRIMARY job: for each finding ID assigned below, run its exact repro from the original cluster report (reports/release-pass/gui/<cluster>.md) and classify VERIFIED_FIXED (behavior now correct, say what you saw) or STILL_BROKEN (evidence). Your SECONDARY job: adversarial sweep for NEW defects the fixes may have introduced (banner order, layout at 1600x900 and one narrow width, semantics states). Write your report to reports/release-pass/gui/waveD-<cluster>.md as you go. Do not fix anything. Screenshots are expensive — prefer the a11y tree; budget ~30 image reads.`
