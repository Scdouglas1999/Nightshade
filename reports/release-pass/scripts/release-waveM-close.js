One graphify query first. Quick pass:
1. Boot to dashboard, connect sim devices, run a short sequence, press Stop once → ONE "Sequence stopped" row, "Stopped by request", no regression from the L-response.
2. a11y error scan on dashboard + run dashboard.
Write reports/release-pass/gui/waveM-close.md. Do not fix anything. Return ONLY the structured result with role='driver'.`,

    `You are the refuter of the Nightshade release pass Wave M, scoped to the FIVE L-response fixes in the newest commit (git log --oneline -3). One graphify query first. Throwaway tests in an untracked dir, deleted after; no repo edits. Attack ONLY:
(a) the rollback origin: does _rollbackStart's 'rollback' origin reach the native call on BOTH rollback shapes (pre-native-launch — where nativeStopRequired is false and no stop is issued — and partial-launch), and does the Rust "System: stop" arm behave for origin strings like '' or 'operator ' (trailing space)?
(b) the spine rule in _foldStopFamilyRows: can a run-id-bearing member still extend the spine into a stepping-stone chain (id-bearing stoppeds 110s apart of the SAME run are legitimate; of DIFFERENT runs are blocked by id inequality — but what about alternating id-less/id-bearing members)? Is D17's greaterThanOrEqualTo(3) the honest contract or a hedge?
(c) the run-id stamp clear: does the clear race the NEXT run's set (start during a slow finalization tail)? Does a cleanupFailed retry double-clear harmlessly?
(d) the retry origin upgrade: a scheduler retry of an OPERATOR's failed stop must NOT downgrade (verify the guard direction); does the upgrade persist if the retry ALSO fails and a third attempt comes from the scheduler?
(e) anything the five fixes broke in adjacent behavior (the launch-parity and operator-stop suites are the canaries).
Be proportionate: file only what an operator would notice or a maintainer must know. Return ONLY the structured result with role='refuter', verified=holds, failed=refuted-with-evidence.`,
