# w13-hotplug-hang — live rig freeze, 2026-09-13

Worktree `agent/w13-hotplug-hang` off `preview/ledger-plus-owner-tree` @ `406957c9d`.

## CHECKPOINT 1 — ROOT CAUSE (confirmed, with citations)

The freeze is **not** hot-plug, **not** DepthLock, **not** a Rust lock and **not** the
plate-solve coalescer. It is a **Dart-side whole-sky catalog load on the UI isolate**,
triggered by the **first plate solve of the process that actually SUCCEEDS**.

### The chain

1. Every captured frame auto-runs the annotation pipeline, fire-and-forget, on the UI
   isolate — `packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/services/annotation_service.dart:259`
   (`handleCurrentImageChanged` → `processNewImage(next)`, not awaited).
2. `processNewImage` plate-solves with mount hints
   (`annotation_pipeline.dart:178` `solveWithFallback`). That is the log's
   `Plate solving near RA/Dec`; the blind half of `solveWithFallback` is the second
   request that logs `already being solved; waiting for that result`.
3. **If the solve FAILS it returns early** — `annotation_pipeline.dart:197-202`. Every
   frame from 23:51–23:54 failed (ASTAP: `Only 0/1/2/4 stars found. Abort`, because the
   owner was still focusing — HFR 16 → 5). So annotation never ran and nothing hung.
4. The owner moved the focuser "one last time" → HFR 4.5/3.87, 2171/2469/4400 sources →
   **ASTAP finally solves** (exit 0). ASTAP's success path logs nothing at INFO
   (`native/nightshade_native/imaging/src/platesolve.rs:1070-1094` only logs the
   non-zero-exit failure), which is exactly why all three logs go quiet on the solve
   instead of printing an outcome.
5. Geometry guards pass (`annotation_pipeline.dart:361-379`), `annotateImage` runs
   (`:386`) → `findObjectsInFov` (`:420`) → `annotationCatalog.searchNearby(...)`
   (`:458`) with `searchRadius ≈ 0.69°` (correctly derived, `:433-437`).
6. **`AnnotationCatalog.searchNearby` answers that 0.69° query by loading the ENTIRE
   sky first** — `packages/nightshade_planetarium/lib/src/catalogs/annotation_catalog.dart:392`
   `await loadAll();`.
7. `AnnotationCatalog.loadAll` (`annotation_catalog.dart:292-378`) calls
   `_gladeLoader.loadAll()` (`:346`), which is
   `packages/nightshade_planetarium/lib/src/catalogs/glade_plus_catalog.dart:109`:

       final lines = await file.readAsLines();

   on the GLADE+ catalog. The file's own comment states the scale —
   `glade_plus_catalog.dart:124`: *"GLADE+ carries ~22M entries"*.

### Why this matches every observation

- `readAsLines()` materialises ~22 million Dart `String`s in one `List`, then the parse
  loop allocates a `GladePlusData` + an `AnnotationObject` + **3 strings per row** for the
  dedup key (`'${obj.ra.toStringAsFixed(2)},${obj.dec.toStringAsFixed(2)}'`,
  `annotation_catalog.dart:322-323`, `:350-351`), plus a `Map<String,List>` spatial index.
  That is multiple GB → **3.2 GB working set, still climbing** (heading for OOM).
- Mutator + GC on one isolate → **~1.25–1.7 cores pinned continuously**.
- All of it is Dart. The bridge is never called again → **zero further Rust log lines**.
- The Flutter **platform/message-pump thread is unaffected**, so the Win32 window still
  reports *Responding* while the UI isolate is wedged. 79 threads.
- **One-time per process** (`_mergedCatalog`/`_cachedData` early-returns), so it hangs on
  the FIRST successful solve after every launch — hence the relaunch hung again ~80 s
  later with no device-change event.
- `annotation_catalog.dart` last changed **2026-06-11**, `glade_plus_catalog.dart`
  **2026-08-16** — both long before the owner's Sep 10 build, which is why the rollback
  hung identically. **Pre-existing, not today's work.**

### Secondary O(n^2) in the same function

`annotation_catalog.dart:336` and `:359` — `final index = objects.indexOf(existing);`
is an O(n) linear scan of the growing list, run per colliding row. Against a
multi-million-element list this is quadratic on its own.

### Cleared lines of inquiry (each checked, not guessed)

- **Hot-plug / serial rediscovery**: serial scans are serialised by a *tokio* async mutex
  and run on `spawn_blocking` (`native/.../native/src/vendor/mod.rs:43-71`) — no std lock
  across blocking I/O. Discovery completed normally at 23:57:55, and is entirely absent
  from hangs 2 and 3. **Red herring.** (Real but separate defect: the LX200/Sky-Watcher/
  iOptron scanners do NOT exclude ports owned by connected devices —
  `native/.../vendor/lx200/discovery.rs:29-59` opens every enumerated port. It fails fast
  with ACCESS_DENIED on Windows so it did not cause this hang.)
- **ZWO EAF handle theft by discovery**: already guarded by the connected-device registry
  (`native/.../vendor/zwo/focuser.rs:604-625`) — discovery skips EAFOpen/EAFClose for a
  connected focuser. Not the cause.
- **Plate-solve coalescer**: `coalesced_solve`
  (`native/.../bridge/src/api/plate_solve.rs:105-183`) waits on a
  `tokio::sync::broadcast` receiver with `.await`, has an `InFlightGuard` Drop that clears
  the entry on panic/cancel, and falls back to solving locally on `Err`. The blind-yield
  loop is bounded at 150 ms and uses `tokio::time::sleep`. **No spin, no deadlock.**
  Both solvers run under `spawn_blocking` (`:546`, and the near path).
- **Unified image storage**: a bounded `lru::LruCache`
  (`native/.../bridge/src/api/imaging.rs:632-639`). Not a leak.
- **Double heartbeat** for `native:zwo_eaf:0` (15 s from device_manager + 10 s from
  api::heartbeat): real duplicate registration, logged twice at 23:47:40, but unrelated to
  the freeze. Deferred per coordinator.

### Contributing (not the freeze) — memory

`api_read_fits_file` (`native/.../bridge/src/api/imaging.rs:1484-1556`) is an `async fn`
that does **all** its work synchronously with no `spawn_blocking` and no `.await`, and
returns `display_data` as a full RGBA buffer: `4656*3520*4` = **65.6 MB per call**, plus a
32.8 MB u16 image and a 16.4 MB u8 stretch buffer live at peak (~115 MB per call in Rust,
65.6 MB copied into Dart). The logs show it called **2–3× per frame**, twice
concurrently. `science_processing_service/private_helpers.dart:554` calls it purely to
read five FITS header fields, paying the whole 65.6 MB stretch+RGBA cost to do it.


---

## CHECKPOINT 2 — REVISED ROOT CAUSE (after the 2nd and 3rd hangs)

The coordinator supplied two more hangs: one ~80 s after relaunch with **no
device-change event**, and one on the owner's **Sep 10 build (7.0.0+27, pre-DepthLock)**.
All three logs end with the identical chain. That kills hot-plug and DepthLock outright
and confirms a pre-existing defect. The chain below is the final answer; Checkpoint 1's
mechanism is correct, and the third log let me pin the trigger precisely.

### The trigger: the first plate solve of the process that SUCCEEDS

| log | last frame | our star count | ASTAP outcome logged? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 23:51–23:54 (healthy) | 0001–0008 | 932–1562 | yes — `Only 0/1/2/4 stars found. Abort` |
| hang 1 (23:55) | 0009 | **2171** | **no** |
| hang 2 (00:01) | 0001 | **2469** | **no** |
| hang 3 (00:07) | 0003 | **4341** | **no** |

ASTAP's success path logs nothing at INFO — `native/nightshade_native/imaging/src/platesolve.rs:1070-1094`
logs only the non-zero-exit case. So "no outcome logged" means **the solve worked**. The
owner was focusing: HFR came down 16 → 5 → 4.5 → 3.98, star counts climbed, and the first
frame ASTAP could actually solve is the frame that froze the app. That is why it read as
"I moved the focuser and it died" and why it recurred within ~80 s of every relaunch.

### What a successful solve unlocks

`AnnotationPipeline.processNewImage` runs on every new frame, fire-and-forget on the UI
isolate (`packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/services/annotation_service.dart:259`). It
plate-solves with mount hints (`annotation_pipeline.dart:178`) — that is the log's
`Plate solving near RA/Dec`. **A failed solve returns at `annotation_pipeline.dart:197-202`**,
which is why 8 frames in a row were harmless. On success it runs the geometry guards
(`:361-379`), then `annotateImage` (`:386`) → `findObjectsInFov` (`:420`) →
`annotationCatalog.searchNearby(...)` (`:458`) with `searchRadius ≈ 0.69°` (correctly
derived, `:433-437`).

### The freeze

`AnnotationCatalog.searchNearby` answered that 0.69° query by loading the whole sky first:

- `packages/nightshade_planetarium/lib/src/catalogs/annotation_catalog.dart:392` — `await loadAll();`
- `annotation_catalog.dart:346` — `loadAll()` calls `_gladeLoader.loadAll()`
- `packages/nightshade_planetarium/lib/src/catalogs/glade_plus_catalog.dart:109` —
  `final lines = await file.readAsLines();`

with the file's own comment at `glade_plus_catalog.dart:124` stating the scale:
**"GLADE+ carries ~22M entries"**.

`readAsLines()` materialises ~22 million Dart `String`s in one list; the loop that follows
is **synchronous** and allocates a `GladePlusData`, an `AnnotationObject` and **three
strings per row** for the dedup key (`annotation_catalog.dart:322-323`, `:350-351`), then
builds a whole-sky `Map<String,List>` index. Consequences, all matching the rig exactly:

- **UI frozen, Win32 window still "Responding"** — the synchronous loop never yields, so
  no other microtask on the UI isolate ever runs again. The Flutter platform/message-pump
  thread is untouched, so Windows still sees a responsive window.
- **No further log output** — the isolate never gets back to any code that calls the
  bridge, so the native log simply stops mid-chain. The last line landing on a FITS read
  is incidental: it is wherever the concurrent science lane happened to be.
- **~1.25–1.7 cores** — one mutator at 100% plus Dart GC helper threads.
- **3.2 GB and climbing** — heading for OOM, not a steady state.
- **Once per process** (`_mergedCatalog`/`_cachedData` early-return), so it reproduces on
  the first successful solve after *every* launch.
- **Pre-existing**: `annotation_catalog.dart` last changed 2026-06-11,
  `glade_plus_catalog.dart` 2026-08-16 — both well before the Sep 10 build, which is why
  the rollback hung identically.

Secondary, same function: `annotation_catalog.dart:336` and `:359` resolved each position
collision with `final index = objects.indexOf(existing);` — an O(n) scan of the growing
merged list, i.e. quadratic in colliding rows on top of being whole-sky.

### Why the two concurrent solves are in the log but are not the bug

Two Dart lanes solve the same frame: the annotation lane (hinted, leads) and the science
lane's `solveForScience`, which calls `_backend.plateSolve` directly and so bypasses the
Dart single-flight gate (`packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/services/science/default_science_backend.dart:56-63`).
The **Rust** coalescer caught what the Dart gate missed and logged
`already being solved; waiting for that result` — `native/.../bridge/src/api/plate_solve.rs:105-183`.
That code is sound: a `tokio::sync::broadcast` receiver awaited (no spin), an
`InFlightGuard` Drop that clears the entry on panic/cancel, a local-solve fallback on
`Err`, a blind-yield loop bounded at 150 ms using `tokio::time::sleep`, and both solvers
under `spawn_blocking`. **Cleared.**

## THE FIX

### 1. Region-scoped streaming catalog queries (the freeze)

New `packages/nightshade_planetarium/lib/src/catalogs/catalog_region_scan.dart`:
`CatalogRegionFilter` (cone + magnitude test, primitives only so it is isolate-sendable)
and `scanCatalogRegion`, which streams the file
(`openRead().transform(utf8.decoder).transform(LineSplitter())`) and keeps only rows
inside the cone, with a `maxResults` backstop and malformed-row counting reported once
instead of logged per row.

- `glade_plus_catalog.dart` — `loadAll`, `_cachedData`, the whole-sky `_spatialIndex` and
  `clearCache` are gone. `searchNearby` now runs `scanGladePlusRegion` inside
  `Isolate.run`. Peak memory is proportional to the answer; the UI isolate never parses.
- `hyperleda_catalog.dart` — the same treatment for its cone query (identical trap, ~3M
  rows). Its by-name helpers still use `loadAll`, because a name lookup genuinely has to
  consider every row; the unread spatial index was removed with its only reader.
- `annotation_catalog.dart` — `searchNearby` queries each backing catalog for the region
  only and merges in priority order, keying collisions through a `Map<String,int>` so a
  merge is O(1) instead of `List.indexOf`. The whole-sky `loadAll`, `_mergedCatalog`,
  `_spatialIndex`, `_gridKey`, plus the unreachable `search`/`count` that depended on
  them, are removed. The public shape `annotation_pipeline` and the existing
  `_ThrowingAnnotationCatalog` test double rely on is unchanged.

The scan also fixes two latent correctness bugs it inherited: the cone test now wraps RA
across the 0h/24h seam (a plain subtraction dropped half a field straddling RA 0), and
`positionOf`/magnitude filtering are applied before anything is retained.

### 2. The 3.2 GB texture leak (contributing, separate defect)

`packages/nightshade_app/lib/screens/imaging/widgets/image_display.dart` replaced
`_decodedImage` on every frame and had **no `dispose()` at all** — the only image widget
in the app that omits it, and the one mounted at native resolution on the Imaging screen.
A `ui.Image` holds its texture off the Dart heap, so dropping the reference leaks it:
**65.6 MB per captured frame** at 4656×3520 (≈45-50 frames to reach 3.2 GB). Now disposes
the replaced image, disposes on the unmounted decode path, and disposes in `dispose()` —
the pattern every sibling already uses (`live_stack_canvas.dart:334-335,379`,
`centering_dialog/image_canvas.dart`, `stacking_panel/stacked_preview.dart`,
`darkroom_screen_parts/_image_surface.dart`, `widgets/astro_image_viewer.dart`).

### Tests

- `packages/nightshade_planetarium/test/catalog_region_scan_test.dart` — 15 tests: cone
  geometry, cos(dec) compression, RA-seam wrap, magnitude cutoff, missing-magnitude
  convention, header skip, malformed-row tolerance, missing-file error, **answer
  proportional to the cone not the catalog**, **the calling isolate keeps being serviced
  for the whole scan** (periodic timer, not a one-shot — a one-shot could slip through the
  old code's awaited `readAsLines`), and truncation under a pathological radius.
- `packages/nightshade_planetarium/test/annotation_catalog_region_merge_test.dart` — 7
  tests: region scoping, brightest-first ordering, collision collapse, magnitude cutoff,
  type filter, unavailable with no loaders, and 4,000 colliding rows completing promptly
  (quadratic under the old `indexOf` merge).
- `packages/nightshade_app/test/screens/imaging/image_display_texture_release_test.dart` —
  2 tests: the replaced texture is released, and the live texture is released on dispose.
  Both **verified to fail** with the dispose calls removed
  ("the replaced texture was leaked" / "the texture outlived the widget that owned it").

### 3. Cached field, so the fix does not trade a freeze for a stall

Removing the whole-sky load alone would mean a background re-read of a
multi-gigabyte catalog on every frame, because the annotation pipeline queries once per
captured frame. `CatalogRegionCache` in `catalog_region_scan.dart` memoises the last
scanned field: each scan covers a cone padded to `radius * 1.5 + 0.1` and is
**magnitude-blind**, so the next frame — whose centre has drifted slightly and whose
SNR-based magnitude cutoff moves frame to frame
(`annotation_pipeline.dart:305-312`) — is enclosed and answered from memory.
Containment uses a true spherical separation (`CatalogRegionFilter.separationDegrees`),
not the small-angle form, because the small-angle approximation is not safe for deciding
whether one cone encloses another. A truncated scan is never cached, since it does not
honestly represent its cone. `clearCache()` on either loader drops it, and
`AnnotationCatalog.clearCache()` still reaches all three loaders, so a re-imported
catalog file is read afresh.

Four more tests cover it: a narrower later cone served from memory (proved by deleting
the file first), a deeper magnitude cutoff still answered correctly, a cone outside the
scanned field re-read rather than guessed, and `clearCache()` forcing a re-read.

---

## CHECKPOINT 3 — a SECOND freeze on the same trigger

While verifying, I found a second defect of the same class, on the same
success-gated path, that would have frozen the rig again seconds after the first fix
landed. It had not been reached when the log went quiet, so it is not the cause of these
three hangs — but it is reachable on every solved frame.

`packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/services/science/default_science_backend/helpers.dart`
`_catalogMatches` matched detected stars to catalog stars with a nested scan: **every**
detected star against **every** projected catalog star. Reachable only with a non-null
`WcsSolution`, i.e. only once a solve succeeds — the same gate as the catalog load. On
the rig's numbers (4,341 detected stars; a catalog cone whose radius is
`clamp(sqrt(w²+h²) × 0.65 + 0.3, 0.25, 8.0)` ≈ 1.1° and can hold tens of thousands of
APASS rows) that is on the order of 10⁸ distance tests with a `sqrt` each, single
threaded, logging nothing while it runs.

Fixed by bucketing: a match must lie within `maxMatchPx`, so with cells that size only
the nine cells around a detection can hold a candidate — same answer, O(n + m) work. The
geometry is extracted to a public pure function,
`packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/services/science/nearest_neighbour_matching.dart`
(`matchNearestUnclaimed`), because the original lived in a `part` file behind private
types and could not be tested. Candidate claiming is still keyed by the catalog star's
id, not its index, so two coincident catalog rows still cannot both be matched — the
behaviour the old code had.

Its test asserts **equivalence, not just speed**: 40 randomised fields (with deliberately
colliding keys) must return exactly what a brute-force reference returns, plus
edge cases — a candidate exactly on the radius, double-claiming, shared keys, negative
coordinates across the cell origin, degenerate input, and the parallel-array contract —
and one scale test at the rig's 4,341 × 50,000 that must finish in under 5 s.

## ONE THING TO CHECK ON THE RIG

The chain requires the **annotation catalog (GLADE+) to be installed**:
`annotation_service.dart:302-316` returns null unless
`getAnnotationCatalogStatus().isInstalled`, and `annotation_pipeline.dart:456` gates on
`isAvailable`. Confirm the file exists and is large — the size is the tell:

    dir "%LOCALAPPDATA%\..\Roaming\...\catalogs"   (whatever annotationCatalogPath resolves to)

If it is installed, the diagnosis is closed. If it is **not** installed, the GLADE+ load
cannot have run, and the prime suspect becomes the `_catalogMatches` nested scan above
(also fixed here) — which is WCS-gated in exactly the same way and needs no catalog
install beyond the bundled HYG fallback.

## VERIFICATION

All commands unpiped, exit codes recorded.

| gate | command | exit | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rust libs | `cargo test -p nightshade_bridge -p nightshade_native --lib` (`TMPDIR=$HOME/.cache/ns-tests`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$HOME/.cache/ns-worktrees/cargo-target`) | **0** | 696 + 202 passed, 0 failed |
| format | `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed packages lib` | **0** | 4287 files, 0 changed |
| analyze (planetarium lib) | `dart analyze lib` | 0 | No issues found |
| analyze (core lib) | `dart analyze packages/nightshade_core/lib` | 0 | 2 infos, both pre-existing in `scheduler/rejection_labels.dart` |
| analyze (app) | `cd packages/nightshade_app && dart analyze` | **0** | 873 infos, all pre-existing; none in any file I touched |
| planetarium | `flutter test --exclude-tags golden --concurrency=3` | **0** | 638 passed (612 baseline + 26 new) |
| core | `flutter test --exclude-tags golden --concurrency=3` | **0** | 6512 passed, 4 skipped |
| app | `flutter test --exclude-tags golden --concurrency=3` | see below | |

`--exclude-tags golden` is the project's own gate (`ns-worktrees/final-verify.sh`). Run
without it, `test/benchmark/golden_compare_test.dart` fails with a 1.9-4.4% pixel delta on
five checkpoints; those goldens are captured on the CI/Windows host and fail on Linux,
which is why the repo excludes them. Nothing outside `catalogs/` in the planetarium
package references `AnnotationCatalog`/`GladePlus`/`HyperLeda`, so the change cannot
affect planetarium paint.

### Windows-only / not executable here — stated plainly

- **The fix itself is pure Dart** and runs identically on Linux and Windows, so unlike
  most rig work there is no untested-platform gap in the change.
- **I could not reproduce the freeze**, because it needs the owner's installed GLADE+
  catalog and a frame that solves. The diagnosis rests on the code path plus the three
  logs agreeing on the trigger; the regression tests pin the properties that make the
  freeze impossible (answer proportional to the cone, calling isolate never starved,
  matching not quadratic) rather than replaying the hang.
- **No Rust was changed**, so the cargo run above is a baseline, not coverage of a change.
  The `#[cfg(windows)]` paths in `hotplug.rs` (the `WM_DEVICECHANGE` window and pump) and
  in the ASCOM wrappers are not compiled or executed on this host and remain untested
  here, as always on this repo.
- `ui.Image.dispose()` behaviour is engine-level and identical across desktop platforms;
  the widget test exercises it under `flutter_test` on Linux.

## STILL OPEN (identified, deliberately not fixed tonight)

Dropped per the coordinator's re-prioritisation, recorded so they are not lost:

1. **Serial rediscovery does not exclude ports a connected device owns.**
   `native/.../vendor/lx200/discovery.rs:29-59` (and the Sky-Watcher / iOptron scanners)
   open every enumerated port, including the COM4 the live NYX mount holds. On Windows the
   second `CreateFile` fails fast with ACCESS_DENIED, and the LX200 scanner treats that as
   "skip this port" (`:63-85`), so it did not cause this hang — but it is a real hazard for
   a driver that shares the handle, and the scan is ~13-25 s of pointless probing per
   bus event. A device-change storm ran full discovery back-to-back for five minutes
   (23:43 → 23:48:50 in log 1).
2. **Double heartbeat registration** for every device: `device_manager` auto-starts one at
   the type's own interval and `api::heartbeat` immediately starts a second at 10 s
   (`native:zwo_eaf:0` at 15 s then 10 s, 23:47:40.702 and .725; same for the camera,
   mount and filter wheel). Real duplicate registration, unrelated to the freeze.
3. **`api_read_fits_file` is a synchronous body in an `async fn`** with no
   `spawn_blocking` (`native/.../bridge/src/api/imaging.rs:1484-1556`), and it returns a
   65.6 MB RGBA buffer. The Dart agent's sweep found **7 of 9 call sites use only
   `fits.width`/`fits.height`** — ~328 MB of transient allocation per frame to read two
   integers. A `width`/`height`-only entry point would remove nearly all of it.
   (`NetworkBackend` already has one: `getFitsDimensions`.)
4. **`histogram256FromRawU16`** runs a 16.4M-iteration loop inside a synchronous Riverpod
   `Provider` on the UI isolate (`services/imaging_service.dart:606-624`), watched during
   build at `imaging_hud.dart:142` — a per-frame UI-thread stall.
5. **`apiAutoStretchImage` is declared `#[frb(sync)]`** and is called with
   `rawData.toList()` (`providers/auto_stretch_provider.dart:217-221`), blocking the UI
   isolate and materialising a 16.4M-element `List<int>`. Gated off by default
   (`auto_stretch_settings.dart:52`), so it only bites if the operator enables auto-stretch.
6. **The science lane's blind solve bypasses the Dart single-flight gate** —
   `default_science_backend.dart:56-63` calls `_backend.plateSolve` directly, which is why
   two solves race for one frame and the Rust coalescer has to catch it. The annotation
   path was already fixed for this; this one was missed.
7. **DepthLock** (not in the Sep 10 build, so not these hangs): `source_mask`
   (`native/.../imaging/src/depthlock/input.rs:366-372`) marks a disk per bright pixel by
   scanning a bounding box — radius 12 is 625 inner iterations per saturated pixel, so a
   moonlit or light-leaked 16 Mpx frame is 10⁸-10¹⁰ scattered writes, silent. Its
   `#[frb(sync)]` `list_goals`/`status` also run on the UI isolate while the store mutex
   is held across an fsync (`store.rs:362`, `:778-801`). Zero-goal guard is correctly in
   place (`engine.rs:181`, `:297-300`), so it does nothing when no goal is configured.

## DESIGN DECISIONS THAT DEVIATE FROM WHAT WAS THERE

1. **A failing catalog query now surfaces instead of being swallowed.** The old
   `AnnotationCatalog.loadAll` wrapped each catalog in `try { … } catch (e) { /* Continue
   without GLADE+ */ }`, so a corrupt or vanished catalog produced a silent "0 objects" —
   a statement about the sky rather than about the read. `searchNearby` now lets the error
   out, where `annotation_pipeline.dart:457,510-519` already converts it to a typed
   `AnnotationCatalogQueryException` and routes it to the pipeline's error state. That
   path exists precisely for this and its own comment asks for this behaviour. The risk is
   bounded: `_loadAnnotationCatalog` only constructs a loader for a catalog that reports
   itself installed with a path, and the OpenNGC loader is null when the DSO catalog is
   absent, so neither is reachable uninstalled.
2. **`AnnotationCatalog.search(query)` and `count` were removed, not ported.** Both read
   the whole merged sky through the `loadAll` that is gone, and nothing in the repo calls
   either. Keeping them would have meant keeping the whole-sky merge alive behind a second
   door. `findClosest` stays and now goes through the region query.
3. **The scan is deliberately magnitude-blind and slightly wide** (`radius × 1.5 + 0.1`)
   so the cached field survives the mount's drift and the pipeline's moving SNR-based
   magnitude cutoff. Scanning exactly the requested cone would have been correct but would
   have missed the cache on nearly every frame.
4. **`matchNearestUnclaimed` is public API in `nightshade_core`** rather than a private
   helper, because the code it replaced sat in a `part` file behind private types and was
   therefore untestable. Exported from both barrels (`nightshade_core.dart` and
   `nightshade_core_services.dart`).
5. **The port-exclusion and lock-discipline work the original brief asked for is not
   here.** The coordinator re-scoped mid-task to the freeze once the Sep 10 rollback
   reproduced it; items 1, 2 and 5 of the original brief were explicitly dropped. Findings
   for all of them are recorded above under "Cleared lines of inquiry" and "Still open" so
   nothing was merely skipped.

## COMMITS

- `847c02abd` fix(annotation): a half-degree query must not load the whole sky
- `7d6e2709d` fix(imaging): release the frame texture, and cache the scanned field
