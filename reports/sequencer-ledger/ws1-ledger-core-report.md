# WS1 — Ledger density mode (core) — report

Workstream: `ws1-ledger-core`. Branch `agent/ws1-ledger-core`, base commit
`23147bf0a` (verified via `git rev-parse HEAD`; the tree was already on it — no
checkout needed). Spec sections delivered: **1 (density modes), 2 (ledger row
anatomy), 3 (rollup summaries)** and the canvas-bar density control. Sections
4–9 are other agents' and were not touched.

## What was built

### Density model — `widgets/sequencer_density.dart` (new)

- `enum SequencerDensity { comfortable, compact, ledger }`, each carrying its
  `label` and Lucide `icon` (`layoutList` / `rows` / `alignJustify`) so the
  three toolbar tiers can never drift on names or glyphs.
- `showsInlineExtras` — true only for `comfortable`; it gates every extra that
  renders *below* a row (progress panel, thumbnail strip, duration chip,
  comment line).
- `sequencerDensityPrefsProvider` — `AsyncNotifier` over `settingsDaoProvider`,
  key `sequencer_density_v1`, storing the bare enum name (the preference is a
  single value; unlike `thumbnail_strip_prefs_v1` there is no second field for
  a JSON object to hold). Missing/unrecognised values fall back to the default.
- `sequencerDensityProvider` — synchronous derived `Provider` that falls back
  to the default while the settings read resolves, so the first painted frame
  is already the mode the user keeps (no comfortable→ledger snap).
- `defaultDensity = ledger` — the point of the mode is that a night fits one
  screen; a preference the user must find first does not deliver that.
- `effectiveSequencerDensity(pref, isMobile:)` — returns `comfortable` when
  `isMobile`, so the phone builder always draws its existing rows.

### Canvas-bar control — `widgets/sequence_toolbar.dart`

Three tiers, mirroring the Timeline/Map group's existing tiering:

- **Labelled** (wide): the repo's `SegmentedControl` with the three mode
  labels inside the view-toggles group.
- **Glyph** (medium): three `NightshadeIconButton`s, one per mode, `selected`
  on the active mode, tooltips `"Comfortable density"` etc.
- **Overflow** (narrow): three `'Density: <label>'` menu entries appended after
  the toggle entries; the active entry is disabled (the menu has no checkmark
  affordance — a no-op tap is how a radio menu says "you are here").

`_densityControlWidth` (244 px) and the toggled width math (9 vs 6 glyph
buttons) account for the control, so the tier thresholds stay honest. The
control is gated on `!isPhone` — the phone builder forces comfortable rows, so
a control there would sell a mode the canvas refuses to draw.

### Ledger row — `widgets/sequence_tree/ledger_row.dart` (new `part`)

- 28 px fixed height, 26 px header, 18 px guide columns with a 1 px
  `colors.border` hairline each, `depth - 1` guides per row.
- Reserved 2 px left running-marker (blank when not running, so the name never
  shifts), 18 px chevron hit box with `AnimatedRotation`, 13 px icon in
  `nodeCategoryTint`, name in `bodySm` (w600 containers / w400 leaves, muted
  when done, line-through when disabled/skipped/cancelled), error colour for
  failed.
- Four right-aligned mono columns 70/60/74/62 px (`readoutXs`), labels
  `Filter / exp`, `Count`, `Duration`, `ETA`; a 26 px eyebrow header inside
  the scroll view top aligns with them.
- 2 px bottom progress bar: primary fraction while running, solid success when
  done, solid error when failed (the failure case is beyond the spec's list,
  but a failed ledger row has no other status stripe).
- Row states: running = primary-tint fill + marker; selected =
  `surfaceElevated` + `foregroundDecoration` ring (a real border would inset
  the content by a pixel on selection); hover fades `surfaceHover` via
  `ValueNotifier<bool>` so a pointer sweep repaints two islands per row, not
  the row's content.
- Hover-revealed kebab in permanently reserved 24 px — appearing actions that
  push the columns sideways make a ledger unreadable exactly when the pointer
  is in it. Always visible on touch.
- Full parity with `_NodeItem`: `_handleNodeSelect` tap/ctrl/shift selection,
  `SequenceTreeContextMenu` (right-click; long-press is claimed by the row's
  `LongPressDraggable` — the menu's secondary-tap path is what the widget test
  exercises), the row `FocusNode` (`skipTraversal`, focus on select), the
  collapsed-container `DragTarget`, `_DropZone`s, tutorial anchors,
  `_NodeValidationWrapper` with a reserved 22 px badge gutter, `Semantics`
  (name + summary + the four column values + state word).
- **Focus identity:** `FocusNode(debugLabel: 'sequence-tree-row')` — the same
  label the comfortable row uses, so focus tests and tooling do not have to
  know which density drew the row.
- **Narrow tier:** `_ledgerColumnsMinWidth = 420`. Below it a `LayoutBuilder`
  drops the whole column block and the header drops its labels — all-or-
  nothing, because a row that kept Duration but lost ETA would read as
  misaligned, and rows disagreeing about the columns' existence breaks the
  ledger's one promise.
- Target headers render as ledger rows in ledger mode: name + RA/Dec chips
  (`CoordinateFormat.raHm/decDm`, `compactLetters` → `05h30m`, `-05°24'`) or a
  `warning` "Not set" chip via `targetCoordinatesUnset`.

### Column values — `sequence_tree/ledger_columns.dart` (new, pure)

- `LedgerColumns` value object + `ledgerColumnsFor(node, sequence, {rollup,
  eta})`: exposure → `Ha 300s` / count / rollup / eta; `SciencePhotometryNode`
  fills capture columns identically; `SmartExposureNode` → `L R G B` / planned
  frames; container → blank filter / `plannedCaptureUnder` frames / rollup /
  eta; everything else → duration + eta only. Duration blank at zero (`<1s`
  reads as a measurement). Frame totals get a `+` when the walk is a floor
  (unbounded repeat / open-ended loop), an em dash when the only imager is
  open-ended, blank when nothing captures.
- `formatLedgerClock` — local 24-h `HH:mm`, hand-formatted so the column is
  identical in every locale.
- `ledgerNodeStarts` — folds `PreSessionSimulationResult.segments` into a
  `Map<String, DateTime>`; containers take the earliest descendant start
  (segments only exist for nodes the estimator bills). Cycle-safe.
- `ledgerEtaProvider` — one map provider over `sequenceTimelineProvider`; rows
  read their entry via `.select`.

### Rollup summaries — `sequence_tree/rollup_summary.dart` (new, pure)

`rollupSummary(container, sequence)` in precedence order:

1. Target — `<name> · Ha/OIII/SII` via `plannedCaptureUnder`
   (`integrationSecsByFilter`, excluding the `No filter` bucket); null → falls
   through so a slew-only target isn't named twice.
2. Filter run — `Ha · OIII · SII 300 s ×12 each · dither every 3`: ≥2 exposure
   children identical in everything but filter (duration, count, frameType,
   gain, offset, binning, dither), all filters named and distinct. The filter
   list runs straight into the spec (`Ha · OIII · SII 300 s ×12 each` is one
   phrase; a ` · ` there would detach the seconds from the bands).
3. Trigger group — every child a watchdog or autofocus with ≥1 watchdog;
   children described by their own `nodeSummary` text because a watchdog's
   threshold is its identity.
4. Generic — first three child names + `+k more`.

Empty container → `''`. Shown on collapsed containers in ledger and compact.

### Tree wiring — `sequence_tree.dart`, `sequence_tree/node_tree_view.dart`

- `SequenceTree.build` resolves `effectiveSequencerDensity` and threads it
  into `_NodeTreeView`; the `_LedgerColumnHeader` sits inside the scroll view
  above the tree in ledger mode.
- `_NodeTreeView` dispatches per node: ledger → `_LedgerRow` for *every* node
  type including targets; otherwise `TargetHeaderCard`/`_NodeItem` as today.
- **Crossfade** is per-row `AnimatedSwitcher` (`durationSmooth`,
  `curveStandard`, zero on `MediaQuery.disableAnimations`) keyed on the
  density — deliberately NOT one switcher around the tree: the outgoing tree
  would keep every `scrollKey`/tutorial `GlobalKey` mounted alongside the
  incoming tree's duplicates ("multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey").
  Inside the scroll key, the outgoing row holds no key the incoming one
  wants.
- Inline extras (progress panel, thumbnail strip, duration chip, comment) are
  gated on `density.showsInlineExtras` — off in compact AND ledger.
- Ledger indent is the 18 px guide column per depth; the children area adds no
  padding in ledger (padding + guides would double-indent).
- Drag feedback in ledger is a `_LedgerRow(isDragging: true)` at
  `_ledgerDragFeedbackWidth` (460 px) so the dragged row looks like the row it
  came from.

### Shared extraction — `node_item_helpers.dart`, `support_widgets.dart`,
`node_item.dart`

- `_NodeItem`'s inline kebab moved verbatim into `_NodeOverflowMenu`
  (`support_widgets.dart`) so the ledger row offers the identical menu —
  including the touch-only Enable/Duplicate/Delete entries and read-only
  "Save as Template".
- `_showSaveAsSnippetDialog`, `_getIcon`, `_getStatusColor`, the container
  type test and `NodeSummaryLine`'s category tint became free functions
  (`showSaveAsSnippetDialog`, `sequenceNodeIcon`, `nodeStatusColor`,
  `isSequenceContainer`, `nodeCategoryTint`); `_NodeItemHelpers` delegates, so
  two rows in one tree can never disagree about what a node looks like.
- `_NodeItem` gained `showInlineExtras` (default true): false suppresses the
  progress panel and comment line for compact mode. The panel's own
  persistence state machine keeps running, so switching back mid-run reveals
  the panel the run is on.

## Tests

New:

- `test/screens/sequencer/widgets/ledger_columns_test.dart` — pure: every
  node-type shape, `+`/em-dash/blank counts, zero-duration blank, clock
  format, ETA map folding incl. detached subtrees.
- `test/screens/sequencer/widgets/rollup_summary_test.dart` — pure: all four
  shapes + every fall-through (mismatched exposures, unfiltered, autofocus-
  only, empty container).
- `test/screens/sequencer/sequencer_density_prefs_test.dart` — persistence
  round-trip, unknown value → default, `effectiveSequencerDensity` mobile.
- `test/screens/sequencer/sequence_tree_ledger_mode_test.dart` — 28 px row
  extent, four headers + values, target coordinate chips (`05h30m`, `-05°24'`),
  chevron → `collapsedNodeIdsProvider` + rollup text, selection + ctrl
  multi-select + context menu (secondary tap), palette drop into expanded and
  collapsed containers, density switch hides/shows inline extras.

Adjusted (density pinned to `comfortable` — these tests assert card-row
content the ledger row intentionally omits):

- `sequence_tree_collapse_all_test.dart` (collapsed ledger rows print a
  rollup naming children, colliding with the "children are gone" assertion)
- `widgets/exposure_card_after_run_test.dart` (4 cases: inline frame tally)
- `widgets/exposure_card_wave_f_events_test.dart` (2 cases)
- `widgets/node_spinner_only_while_executing_test.dart` (3 cases: the spinner
  is card-only; ledger marks running via tint + bar)
- `widgets/node_summary_inline_edit_test.dart` (5 cases: editable summary
  chips live on the card's summary line)

Each override carries a comment saying why.

## Deviations from the spec

1. **Failure progress bar.** Spec §2 lists primary-while-running and
   success-when-complete. A failed ledger row also fills its bar `error` —
   ledger rows have no status stripe, and an unmarked failure loses the one
   outcome the operator most needs to spot.
2. **Per-row crossfade** rather than one tree-level `AnimatedSwitcher` —
   required by the registry GlobalKeys (see above); the visual result is the
   same tree-wide crossfade.
3. **Narrow tier hides columns below 420 px.** Spec requires aligned columns
   but also that narrow layouts not overflow; at ~271 px (one narrow-pane
   test) 314 px of fixed chrome cannot fit. All-or-nothing rather than
   dropping ETA first, which would read as misalignment.
4. **Kebab in reserved width** rather than appearing on hover — reserved
   rather than inserted so the columns never shift under the pointer.
5. **`sequencer_density_v1` stores the bare enum name**, not the JSON object
   `thumbnail_strip_prefs_v1` uses — one value, no object to hold.
6. **Focus `debugLabel` unified** to `sequence-tree-row` (not a ledger-
   specific label) — the label is the row's identity to shortcuts/tests, and
   density must not change it.

## Review fixes

An adversarial senior review of the six original commits found nine defects.
All nine are fixed on this branch.

### 1. HIGH — Ledger rows had no Enable/Duplicate/Delete actions

`_NodeOverflowMenu`'s trio entries are gated on `isTouch`, so a desktop
ledger row showed only the kebab and the three callbacks threaded from
`node_tree_view.dart` were dead code.

**Fix:** the eye/duplicate/delete chips were extracted from `_NodeItem` into
`_NodeActionChips` (`support_widgets.dart`, callback types corrected to
`VoidCallback?`), and `_LedgerRow._buildActions` renders them plus the kebab
inside a permanently reserved `_ledgerActionsWidth` slot (3×28 + 24 = 108 px)
on pointer platforms, so hover reveal cannot shift the columns. On touch the
trio stays inside the kebab (see item 7). `_ledgerColumnsMinWidth` moved
420 → 500 because the wider reservation pushed the depth-1 fixed cost to
437 px; the old threshold sat below the row's own cost.

**Test:** `sequence_tree_ledger_mode_test.dart` — "hover reveals the action
chips; Delete removes the node" drives a real mouse pointer onto a row (with
a linux-platform theme, since the suite's default platform is touch), taps
Delete, confirms the dialog, asserts the node is gone.

### 2. HIGH — ETA anchored to a stale `DateTime.now()`; no actual starts

`sequenceTimelineProvider` simulates once at `DateTime.now()` and never
refreshes, and spec §2's "finished nodes show the actual start time" was
unimplemented.

**Fix** (`ledger_columns.dart`):
- `ledgerClockProvider` — a `Stream.periodic(1 min)` stream gated on
  `sequenceExecutionStateProvider.canStart`: it emits only while the executor
  is settled, so no timer runs during a run. Riverpod cancels the
  subscription on rebuild/dispose, which kills the timer with it.
- `ledgerActualStartsProvider` — a `StateNotifier` folding the typed
  `nightshadeEventsProvider` stream (the same `ref.listen` fold
  `eventHistoryProvider` uses): `SequencerEvent_Started` clears the map,
  `SequencerEvent_NodeStarted` records the event envelope's millisecond
  timestamp per node id.
- `ledgerEtasFor(sequence, simulation, {now, runActive, runStart,
  actualStarts})` — pure, fake-clock-testable. Pre-run it shifts the whole
  simulation to `now`; during a run it shifts to
  `sessionStateProvider.startTime` (falling back to the simulation anchor
  while `startSession` resolves). Observed starts always win, and both the
  predicted and observed maps fold through `_foldStarts`, so a container
  inherits the earliest start — predicted or observed — in its subtree.
- `LedgerEta{start, isActual}` lets the row mark a started-but-unobserved
  ETA `textMuted` rather than present a stale prediction as fact.

**Timestamp model note:** `SequenceProgress` and the exposure tally carry no
per-node timestamps; `sessionStateProvider.startTime` is the only run-start
record. Actual per-node starts come from the typed `NodeStarted` event
envelopes — the only timestamp source that exists — so the "actual" ETA is
as precise as the event stream's delivery (millisecond envelope stamps).
`LedgerEta.isActual` keeps observed and predicted values visually distinct.

**Tests:** six `ledgerEtasFor` unit tests in `ledger_columns_test.dart`
(pre-run re-anchor, run-anchor, missing-run-start fallback, actual-beats-
prediction, actual folding into the parent, actuals-without-simulation) and
the muted-ETA widget test in `sequence_tree_ledger_mode_test.dart`.

### 3. MED-HIGH — Compact collapsed rows had no rollup summary

**Fix:** `_NodeItem` watches `rollupSummaryMapProvider.select` only when
`!showInlineExtras && isCollapsed && hasChildren` and appends the summary to
the title row in `textMuted`, single-line ellipsised — the same provider the
ledger row uses, so the two densities cannot disagree.

**Test:** "compact mode shows the rollup summary on a collapsed container"
flips to compact, collapses the loop, and asserts `L · R 60 s ×10 each`.

### 4. MED — Running-row progress groove laid out at 0×0

**Fix:** the `surfaceHover` track inside the progress `Stack` is now
`Positioned.fill`, so it takes the bar's bounds instead of the loose-Stack
zero size.

**Test:** "a running row paints the progress groove under its fill" finds the
track ColoredBox and the 0.4 `FractionallySizedBox` fill under it.

### 5. MED — Per-row `LayoutBuilder` + O(N·depth) column/rollup work per tick

**Fix:**
- `ledgerColumnsMapProvider` and `rollupSummaryMapProvider` are map providers
  keyed off `currentSequenceProvider` — the subtree walks run once per
  sequence change, and rows read their own entry via `.select`.
- The width decision is hoisted into `SequenceTree`'s single existing
  `LayoutBuilder` (see item 6); `_LedgerRow` has no `LayoutBuilder` at all.
- ETAs deliberately live in their own map (`ledgerEtaProvider`) so the
  minute/event ticks don't invalidate the static columns.

### 6. MED — Toolbar/tree responsive signals disagreed; narrow tier stripped columns

**Fix:** the density control's visibility now uses the same short-side
predicate the layout does — `BreakpointTokens.isPhone(min(width, height))`
instead of `Responsive.isPhone(context)` — so a narrow-but-tall desktop
window keeps the control. And below `_ledgerColumnsMinWidth` the tree's
hoisted `LayoutBuilder` resolves `canvasDensity` to compact: the preference
says what is wanted, the canvas says what it can host, and a ledger row
never draws without its columns.

**Tests:** `sequence_toolbar_density_test.dart` (labelled `SegmentedControl`
tier and glyph tier, each asserting all three modes and the persisted write);
"a canvas below the column floor falls back to compact rows" in the ledger
test file.

### 7. LOW — Ledger kebab was 24×28 on touch

**Fix:** the actions slot's width is `_ledgerActionsSlotWidth(context)` —
`_ledgerActionsWidth` on pointer platforms, `NightshadeTouchTarget.minExtent`
on touch — and the touch branch wraps the kebab in an `OverflowBox` at that
extent so its hit area clears the platform floor symmetrically over the
28 px row instead of clipping to it. The header's reservation uses the same
helper, so the columns stay aligned on both platforms.

### 8. LOW — `nodeCategoryTint` could drift from `NodeSummaryLine._categoryColor`

**Fix:** `NodeSummaryLine.categoryColorForTesting` (`@visibleForTesting`
static accessor) exposes the card's mapping, and
`category_tint_agreement_test.dart` asserts it equals `nodeCategoryTint` for
every `NodeCategory`.

### 9. LOW — Coverage gaps

Added: hover→Delete flow, long-press drag reorder (stationary-press +
`startGesture` — `timedDrag` moves inside `LongPressDraggable`'s 150 ms
window and never arms), the inter-row `_DropZone` at its index, semantics
label contents (name + column values + state), the running progress groove,
the compact collapsed rollup, the tint agreement, the toolbar's labelled and
glyph tiers, and the six `ledgerEtasFor` anchoring tests.

A note on the clock's test surface: `ledgerClockProvider` is a real periodic
stream, and a periodic zone timer cannot survive a widget test's teardown —
`autoDispose` deactivates too late to help. Tests that pump a ledger tree
stub it with `Stream<DateTime>.empty()` (the same seam the suite already
uses for `tickerProvider`), and the anchoring math is covered through the
fake-clock unit tests instead.

## Left undone

- Nothing in scope. Mobile is intentionally untouched per the brief.
- The 11 pre-existing format-drift files and 7 pre-existing analyzer warnings
  outside this workstream's file list were left as-is; fixing them would edit
  files other agents may own.
