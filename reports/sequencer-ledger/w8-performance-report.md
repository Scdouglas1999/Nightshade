# w8-performance — Nightshade desktop performance audit

Workstream `w8-performance`, base `d6a1caeb3`, branch `agent/w8-performance`.
Owner's brief: "Make sure the app is running using low resources and constantly
at my monitor's refresh rate... it feels like maybe it's chugging a little?"

Measure first. Every claim below carries the command and the number.

## Setup (exit codes)

| step | command | exit |
|---|---|---|
| bootstrap | `melos bootstrap` | 0 |
| bridge hash | `rustContentHash` = `-1467366630` (dart) == `FLUTTER_RUST_BRIDGE_CODEGEN_CONTENT_HASH` = `-1467366630` (rust) | match, no rebuild |

`apps/desktop/linux/CMakeLists.txt` resolves the bridge at
`native/nightshade_native/target/release/libnightshade_bridge.so`, not at
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`. In this worktree that path did not exist and the first
`flutter build linux --release` failed with "Rust library not found". Symlinked
`native/nightshade_native/target -> /home/scdouglas/.cache/ns-worktrees/cargo-target`
(worktree-local, untracked) and the build proceeds.

## 1. Baseline: idle CPU per screen (release bundle, GUI harness)

Harness: `tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py --profile w8perf`, `NS_AUDIT_DISPLAY=:96`,
Xvfb `1920x1200x24`, `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1` + `GALLIUM_DRIVER=softpipe`.
Profile seeded from `~/.cache/nightshade-ledger-preview/data` minus
`nightshade.db.lock` (past onboarding, Sim Rig connected, two saved sequences).

`pidstat` is not installed on this host, so CPU is sampled from `/proc/<pid>/stat`
(utime+stime deltas against wall clock) by `/tmp/ns-audit/w8perf/measure.py`,
20 one-second samples per screen. Per-thread splits come from
`/tmp/ns-audit/w8perf/threads.py` (same source, `/proc/<pid>/task/*/stat`).

Softpipe inflates raster; treat these as an UPPER BOUND on the owner's machine.
What does NOT depend on the rasteriser is the *shape*: which screens produce
frames at idle at all.

| screen (idle, nothing running) | mean %CPU | max %CPU | RSS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weather | 107.66 | 132.77 | 381.6 MB |
| Tonight | 96.22 | 130.97 | 361.5 MB |
| Guiding | 85.03 | 139.96 | 223.9 MB |
| Plan | 62.33 | 89.98 | 222.4 MB |
| Imaging | 55.53 | 106.98 | 236.6 MB |
| Analytics | 54.88 | 76.97 | 226.4 MB |
| Equipment | 53.38 | 78.97 | 202.7 MB |
| Sequencer — ledger, "NGC 7000 + M31 · full night" (36 nodes) | 37.39 | 62.98 | 255.6 MB |
| Sequencer — empty "New Sequence" | 37.14 | 57.99 | 231.7 MB |
| Darkroom | 30.34 | 49.99 | 358.5 MB |

An idle desktop app should sit near 0%. None of these do.

### The cost is full-window rasterisation, not Dart

Per-thread split on Tonight, 12 s window (`threads.py 12`):

```
window=12.0s  total=98.4%
    70.99%  io.flutter.rast    (raster thread)
    27.41%  nightshade_desk    (GTK platform thread — GL swap/blit)
```

`io.flutter.ui` — the Dart thread that runs `build()` — does not even clear the
0.4% reporting floor. So the idle cost is not a rebuild storm. Frames are being
*produced and rasterised* continuously while nothing changes.

Confirmed by scaling the window, same screen, same state:

| Tonight, window size | area | mean %CPU |
|---|---|---|
| 1920x1200 | 2.30 Mpx | 94.44 |
| 800x600 | 0.48 Mpx | 23.53 |

4.8x the pixels, 4.0x the CPU. The work is per-pixel, and the frame count is
what drives it. On the owner's GPU each frame is far cheaper than under
softpipe — but the app is still waking up, rebuilding a layer tree and
submitting a full-window frame every vsync while sitting still, which is
exactly what "chugging" and a hot laptop feel like.

The remaining question is therefore: **what schedules a frame at idle?**

## 2. Frame timing: what ticks at idle, and why

Profile bundle (`flutter build linux --profile`, exit 0) launched on the same
Xvfb with the Dart VM service enabled through engine switches — the GTK runner
forwards `argv` only as Dart entrypoint args, so the port comes from
`FLUTTER_ENGINE_SWITCHES` / `FLUTTER_ENGINE_SWITCH_n=observatory-port=...`.
`Flutter.Frame` extension events are collected over the VM-service WebSocket by
`/tmp/ns-audit/w8prof/frames.py` (counts + build/raster percentiles) and
`/tmp/ns-audit/w8prof/gaps.py` (inter-frame gaps, which is what identifies a
*periodic* source).

### The app renders ~1.5 frames a second while sitting completely still

`gaps.py "Tonight idle" 20`, window shrunk to 500x400 first so softpipe's raster
cost cannot be the limiter (raster there is 12.6 ms, well inside a gap):

```
Tonight idle @500x400: 32 frames in 20s
  gaps(ms): [233, 766, 684, 317, 233, 66, 701, 1000, 233, 767, 1000, 233, 766,
             1000, 234, 767, 1000, 233, 767, 1000, 233, 767, 1000, 232, 768,
             1000, 233, 766, 1001, 233, 766]
```

The steady state is a perfectly repeating `233, 767, 1000` cycle — 3 frames every
2 seconds — which decomposes into exactly two periodic sources:

* **1 Hz, aligned to the wall-clock second** (frames at t=0, 1, 2, 3 …).
* **0.5 Hz, offset +233 ms** (frames at t=0.233, 2.233, 4.233 …).

Build time for those frames is `p50 = 0.15 ms`. Nothing is thrashing in Dart.
Each of them is a *full-window rasterisation* anyway, because:

```
nm -D --defined-only libflutter_linux_gtk.so | grep -c damage   ->  0
strings libflutter_linux_gtk.so | grep -iE 'partial_update|buffer_age|existing_damage|FlutterDamage'  ->  (nothing)
```

The shipped GTK embedder has no damage-region support at all. So one changed
digit costs the same as a full redraw. The `_TimeDisplay` comment in
`status_bar/temperature_and_time.dart` already said this; the symbol check is
the proof, and the raster numbers are the price.

The same `233 / ~880 / ~900` cycle appears on **every** screen measured —
Tonight, Darkroom, Guiding, Imaging, Weather, Sequencer — including screens
that display no mount and no device readouts. So both sources are in the shell,
not the screens.

### Source B identified: the mount position poll, through a whole-object watch

`packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/providers/equipment/mount_state_provider.dart:34`

```dart
static const _normalPollInterval = Duration(seconds: 2);
```

`_pollPosition()` publishes a fresh `MountState` every 2 s while a mount is
connected — RA/DEC/ALT move continuously, so it is never a no-op write.

`packages/nightshade_app/lib/screens/shell/widgets/status_bar.dart:281` watched
the **whole** provider:

```dart
final mountState = ref.watch(mountStateProvider);
```

but the bar only ever reads three fields from it — `connectionState`,
`deviceName`, `deviceId` (lines 289, 312-313, 352). It never reads the position.
The status bar is mounted on every screen, so a position update the bar does not
display rebuilt the bar, dirtied the frame and repainted the entire window,
every 2 seconds, forever, everywhere.

Confirmed by measuring on **Darkroom**, which shows no mount UI at all — the
+233 ms source is present there too:

```
BEFORE Darkroom idle: 28 frames in 16s
  gaps(ms): [101, 766, 1000, 234, 849, 918, 233, 866, 900, 234, 900, 866, ...]
```

### Source A: the status-bar seconds digit (1 Hz) — reported, not changed

`_TimeDisplay` renders `HH:mm:ss`. It is already correct engineering: it owns
its own tick (so it does not `setState` the whole bar), it is aligned to the
epoch second via `AlignedTicker` (so it shares a frame with the planetarium's
two 1 Hz clocks rather than costing a phase of its own), and it stops when the
app is backgrounded. There is nothing left to fix in it *as written*.

What it costs is a product fact, not a bug: because the embedder cannot do a
partial repaint, **displaying a seconds digit costs one full-window frame per
second on every screen, for the life of the process**. Dropping the `:ss` — or
showing seconds only on screens that need them — would remove 2 of every 3
remaining idle frames. That is the owner's call, so it is reported, not taken.

## 3. Refresh rate: what the app does today

**Nothing sets, queries, or caps the display refresh rate on desktop.**

* `flutter_displaymode` is not a dependency (`grep -rn "displaymode" apps/desktop packages/*/lib` → no matches outside the planetarium's own FPS *readout*).
* `apps/desktop/linux/runner/{main.cc,my_application.cc}` is the stock Flutter GTK runner. It forwards `argv` to `fl_dart_project_set_dart_entrypoint_arguments` and nothing else — no GL swap-interval call, no engine switches, no frame throttling.
* The only explicit cadence control in the app is `AlignedTicker`
  (`packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/utils/aligned_ticker.dart`), and it does not
  cap anything: it *phase-aligns* the app's 1 Hz clocks to the epoch second so
  their ticks coalesce into one frame instead of three. It is the fix for the
  historical "idle frame rate = number of independently-phased clocks" defect,
  and it is still doing its job — four call sites, all 1 Hz, all aligned:
  `status_bar/temperature_and_time.dart:148`, `clock_provider.dart:228`,
  `planetarium_providers/observer_time.dart:158` and `:227`.

So the app takes whatever cadence GTK/EGL gives it, which on a normal desktop is
the monitor's vsync. Nothing fights it and nothing pins it to a lower rate.

**The thing that does NOT hold the monitor's rate is the cost per frame, not the
cadence.** Flutter's shipped Linux embedder has no partial-repaint path at all:

```
nm -D --defined-only build/.../lib/libflutter_linux_gtk.so | grep -c damage       -> 0
strings ... | grep -iE 'partial_update|buffer_age|existing_damage|FlutterDamage'  -> (nothing)
```

Every dirty frame is a full-window redraw. That is why the two idle clocks
measured above cost what they cost, and why per-tile `RepaintBoundary`s (which
let the raster cache return unchanged layers) are the lever that actually
applies on the owner's GPU, where per-pixel raster is cheap but re-painting
every card's text and gradient still is not.

## 4. The real display — the number that actually answers the question

The harness cannot measure vsync, so the profile bundle was launched **once** on
the owner's desktop, against a scratch database at `/tmp/ns-audit/w8real/data`
(seeded from a copy of the preview data, never the preview's own directory), and
closed again. Exactly what was launched and closed:

```
DISPLAY=:0 NIGHTSHADE_DATABASE_DIR=/tmp/ns-audit/w8real/data \
  NIGHTSHADE_DATA_DIR=/tmp/ns-audit/w8real/data \
  apps/desktop/build/linux/x64/profile/bundle/nightshade_desktop     # pid 2177316
...measured for ~2 minutes on the Tonight screen...
kill 2177316                                                         # "closed 2177316 cleanly"
```

`~/.cache/nightshade-ledger-preview` was not touched and the owner's preview
process was not signalled.

**The monitor is 5120x1440 @ 239.90 Hz** (`DISPLAY=:0 xrandr`). That is a
**4.17 ms** frame budget over a **7.37 Mpx** window.

Idle, 30 s sample, warmed up (`frames.py`, `measure.py`):

```
REAL DISPLAY idle (30s confirm)
  window=30.3s  frames=50  FPS=1.6
  build  ms: p50=  0.58 p90=  0.81 p99=  1.15 max=  1.15
  raster ms: p50=  4.31 p90=  5.29 p99= 16.93 max= 16.93
  total  ms: p50=  6.50 p90=  7.92 max= 19.89
  frames over 16.67ms: 1/50 (2%)
REAL DISPLAY idle CPU   n=20  meanCPU=10.70%  maxCPU=16.00%  RSS=141.6MB
```

### The answer

* **Idle cost on the owner's machine is 10.7% CPU and 142 MB, not the 30-108% the
  harness reports.** Softpipe inflates raster by roughly 50-75x; every CPU number
  in section 1 is an upper bound and should be read for its *shape*, not its
  magnitude. The app is not heavy at rest.
* **The app cannot hold 240 Hz, and no setting is stopping it.** A single
  full-window frame costs `p50 = 6.50 ms` end to end (`4.31 ms` of it raster)
  against a `4.17 ms` budget. That is 1.6x over at the median and 1.9x at p90.
  Nothing throttles the app — there is no swap-interval call, no display-mode
  API, no frame cap (section 3). The frame simply costs more than 1/240 s to
  produce, because the embedder has no damage region and repaints all 7.37 Mpx
  for any change.
* **It holds 60 Hz comfortably**: 1 frame in 50 exceeded 16.67 ms at idle.
* So "chugging" at 240 Hz is real and is a *per-frame cost* problem, not a
  cadence problem. The levers are (a) fewer frames when nothing changed, and
  (b) cheaper frames via `RepaintBoundary` so the raster cache can return
  unchanged layers. Both are exercised below.

### What ticks at idle on real hardware

`whichframe.py` clusters build events into frames and names them. On the real
display, on Tonight, the idle cadence is exactly two sources:

```
  t=  0.000s  n=36  DeviceRow, Divider, Expanded, Flexible, ...     <- every 2.000s
  t=  0.250s  n=31  InstrumentPill, RawTooltip, OverlayPortal, ...  <- every 1.000s
  t=  1.250s  n=31  InstrumentPill, RawTooltip, OverlayPortal, ...
  t=  2.000s  n=36  DeviceRow, Divider, Expanded, Flexible, ...
  t=  2.250s  ...
```

* **1 Hz** — `_TimeDisplay`, the status-bar seconds digit. Unavoidable given it
  renders `HH:mm:ss`.
* **0.5 Hz** — `DeviceRow` in the Tonight dashboard's Equipment card, which
  *does* display RA/DEC/ALT, so the 2 s mount poll legitimately changes what is
  on screen there.

**The semantics-only frames that appeared in the harness are a harness
artifact.** In the harness they showed as a third source with no widget rebuild
at all — only `Semantics.ensureGeometry` / `Semantics.updateChildren`:

```
  t=  1.300s  n=  8  Semantics.ensureGeometry, Semantics.ensureSemanticsNode,
                     Semantics.updateChildren, UncontrolledProviderScope
```

`drive_linux.py` sets `GTK_MODULES=gail:atk-bridge` and `NO_AT_BRIDGE=0` so the
accessibility tree exists for `tree`. With no AT client attached — the normal
case on the owner's desktop — Flutter builds no semantics tree and those frames
do not happen. They are absent from the real-display trace above. Worth knowing
for any future sweep: **the harness costs the app a frame every 2 s that a real
user never pays.**

## 5. Fixes, with before/after numbers

### Fix 1 — the status bar watched five device providers whole (`30bb65e5a`)

`packages/nightshade_app/lib/screens/shell/widgets/status_bar.dart` and
`.../status_bar/temperature_and_time.dart`.

The bar is mounted on every screen. It watched `cameraStateProvider`,
`mountStateProvider`, `guiderStateProvider`, `focuserStateProvider` and
`filterWheelStateProvider` as whole objects while rendering a handful of fields
from each — and never the mount's position at all. The 2 s position poll
therefore rebuilt the bar, dirtied the frame and repainted the whole window on
every screen in the app.

Now each watch is a `.select` of exactly the rendered fields. Records compare
structurally and the field names are unchanged, so no render code moved.

**Before / after, idle rebuild trace on Tonight** (`rebuilds.py`, 12 s window,
same screen, same seeded profile):

| widget rebuilt at idle | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `InstrumentPill` | 74 | not in the top-28 |
| `Readout` | 54 | 63 *(dashboard Equipment card, legitimate)* |
| `_Dot` | 42 | gone |

The device pills leave the idle path entirely. What remains on Tonight is
`DeviceRow` / `ReadoutRow` / `Readout` — the dashboard's Equipment card, which
displays RA/DEC/ALT and must update.

**Effect on the frame count:** on a screen that shows no mount, the 0.5 Hz frame
disappears and idle goes from 3 frames per 2 s to 2 — a third fewer full-window
repaints. On Tonight it does not, because the Equipment card genuinely displays
the position.

### Fix 2 — a `RepaintBoundary` per dashboard tile (`30bb65e5a`)

`packages/nightshade_app/lib/screens/dashboard/widgets/dashboard_tile.dart` had
**zero** `RepaintBoundary` in the whole dashboard directory
(`grep -rc RepaintBoundary screens/dashboard` → 0), on the screen with the
highest idle cost. Every tile shared one layer, so the once-a-second clock tick
repainted every card's text, gradients and charts from scratch.

Each tile now gets a boundary when not in edit mode (not while dragging: a tile
that moves every frame only collects cache misses behind a boundary).

**Before / after, release bundle in the harness, Tonight, idle, 20 s samples:**

| | mean %CPU |
|---|---|
| before | 96.22 |
| after, 4 independent samples | 80.82, 77.38, 74.63, 83.18 (mean 79.0) |

All four after-samples fall below the before-sample, an ~18% reduction. The frame
*count* on Tonight is unchanged (3 per 2 s before and after), so this is a
per-frame raster saving — which is exactly what a boundary buys, and exactly the
lever that still applies on the owner's GPU.

### Honest negative result: the other screens did not move in the harness

| screen | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Weather | 107.66 | 101.68 |
| Guiding | 85.03 | 93.30 |
| Plan | 62.33 | 70.32 |
| Imaging | 55.53 | 54.48 |
| Equipment | 53.38 | 54.18 |
| Analytics | 54.88 | 36.04 |
| Darkroom | 30.34 | 42.82, then 28.04 / 30.84 / 37.28 on repeat |

Repeat sampling on Darkroom gave 28.04, 30.84, 37.28 and 42.82 for the *same*
build and screen — a spread of ±25%. **Softpipe CPU is too noisy to resolve a
single removed frame per 2 s**, and on these screens the harness's own
accessibility tick keeps the 0.5 Hz frame alive anyway (section 4). The
frame-level trace, not the CPU number, is the evidence that fix 1 works.

## 6. This session's sequencer additions — are they as cheap as claimed?

Checked against the brief's list. All five hold up; numbers where I have them.

**`ledgerClockProvider` (per-minute)** —
`sequence_tree/ledger_columns.dart:433`. A `StreamProvider.autoDispose` that
yields once then every 60 s. One consumer (`ledgerEtaProvider`); `autoDispose`
means a process that never opens a sequencer never subscribes. One frame a
minute is 1/60th of what the status-bar clock already costs. **Cheap as
claimed.**

**Running-row breath animation (gated)** —
`sequence_tree/support_widgets.dart:691`. `RepaintBoundary` wraps
`OnScreenAnimationGate` from the OUTSIDE, which is the correct order and the one
the repo has been burned by before: a boundary inside the gate makes the marker
its own layer, the gate's observer never sees a paint, and it silently stops the
animation two ticks in while looking like a perf win. Verified correct here, and
in all ten `OnScreenAnimationGate` call sites in the tree — none has a boundary
inside the gate. **Correct as claimed.**

**Gutter map `RepaintBoundary`** — `sequence_tree/gutter_map.dart:116`. The
boundary is the `AnimatedBuilder`'s `child`, so it is built once and handed
through rather than rebuilt per scroll pixel, and `SequenceMapPainter`
(`sequence_minimap.dart:240`) takes `super(repaint: scrollController)` so the
picture repaints from the controller without any rebuild at all. **Correct.**

**`AnimatedBuilder` on the scroll controller** — same widget. Its `builder`
rebuilds a `Semantics` node on every scroll pixel, which is real work, but it is
deliberate (the comment says so: the rebuild exists for the semantics `value`)
and it did not show up as a build storm — see the scroll numbers below. On a
desktop with no AT client attached the semantics node is not even materialised.
**Not a problem at the measured cost**; flagged for the owning agent only
because it is the one per-pixel rebuild in the ledger.

**Sticky-ancestor measurement once per frame** — `sequence_tree.dart:392`.
`_scheduleStickyPass` is guarded by `_stickyPassScheduled` to one post-frame pass
per frame, short-circuits on `listEquals`, and is gated off entirely in
Comfortable density before any render box is touched. The walk over
`_visibleOrder` calling `_rowBounds` breaks at the anchor row, so it is O(rows
above the viewport top) rather than O(all rows) — worst case at the bottom of a
long sequence. **Cheap as claimed at 36 nodes**; worth re-measuring if a
sequence ever reaches several hundred rows.

**`.select`-based rebuild scoping** — held up under measurement.

**Measured, ledger loaded with "NGC 7000 + M31 · full night" (36 nodes):**

| state | frames | build p50 | build p99 | build max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| idle | 1.6/s | 0.15-0.91 ms | — | — |
| continuous wheel scrolling, 16 s | 1.6/s | **0.91 ms** | **12.74 ms** | **12.74 ms** |

A build storm would show as a p99 in the tens of milliseconds and a frame rate
pinned to the scroll. Neither happens. **The sequencer is not the source of the
owner's problem** — the ledger screen was the *second cheapest* of the ten
measured (37.4% vs Weather's 107.7% in the harness).

## 7. Findings I could not fix — files owned by other agents

None of these are defects I can prove cost anything at the measured scale; they
are recorded so the owning agent has the numbers.

* **`gutter_map.dart`** — `AnimatedBuilder(animation: widget.scrollController)`
  rebuilds its `Semantics` wrapper once per scroll pixel. Measured cost during a
  16 s continuous scroll of a 36-node ledger: build `p50 = 0.91 ms`,
  `p99 = 12.74 ms`. Acceptable today. If the gutter ever gains content in that
  builder, this is where it will be paid. No change recommended on these numbers.
* **`sequence_minimap.dart`** — `SequenceMapPainter` is wired correctly
  (`super(repaint: scrollController)`, boundary above it). No finding.
* `target_queue_panel.dart`, `toolbox_panel.dart`, `node_properties_panel.dart`,
  `builder_layout.dart`, `collapsible_panel.dart`, `sequence_toolbar.dart`,
  `nightshade_text_field.dart` — nothing in the idle or scroll traces attributed
  a frame to any of them. No findings.

## 8. Recommendation the owner has to decide (not taken unilaterally)

**The status-bar clock shows `HH:mm:ss`.** Because the Linux embedder has no
damage region, that seconds digit costs one full-window repaint per second on
every screen, forever — 2 of the 3 remaining idle frames per 2 s. At the owner's
window size that is a `6.50 ms` frame, once a second, at rest.

Dropping `:ss` (or showing seconds only where they matter) would take idle from
~1.5 fps to ~0.5 fps. It changes what is on screen, so it is the owner's call,
not mine. Everything needed to make the change is in
`status_bar/temperature_and_time.dart:198`.

Second, larger lever, and the honest answer to "240 Hz": the app produces a
`p50 = 6.50 ms` frame against a `4.17 ms` budget. Closing that gap is a
`RepaintBoundary`-coverage campaign across the heavy screens (Weather's map,
Guiding's graphs, Tonight's remaining panels), of which fix 2 is one screen's
worth and measured an ~18% reduction. That is a piece of work, not a patch.

## 9. Verification (exit codes, unpiped)

| # | command | exit | notes |
|---|---|---|---|

| 4 | `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed packages/nightshade_app packages/nightshade_core packages/nightshade_ui` | 1 | **pre-existing**: 41 files changed, none mine. `dart format` on my three files reports "0 changed". |
| 5 | `cd packages/nightshade_app && dart analyze` | 2 | **pre-existing**: 887 issues, ALL severity `info` (deprecations), **zero** in any file I touched. Confirmed by grepping the log for `status_bar.dart`, `dashboard_tile.dart`, `temperature_and_time.dart` — no hits. |
| 6 | `flutter test test/screens/sequencer --concurrency=3` | 1 | 734 pass, **2 fail, both pre-existing** — see below |

| 8 | `flutter test test/screens/dashboard --concurrency=3` | 1 | 182 pass, **1 fail, pre-existing** |

`status_bar_idle_repaint_test.dart` — the test that pins the status bar's
per-second rebuild scope with Flutter's rebuild tracer — **passes** with the
change.

### The five failures are pre-existing at `d6a1caeb3`

Proven, not assumed: my three files were checked out at base
(`git checkout d6a1caeb3 -- <files>`), the failing test files re-run, and they
failed identically. Then restored to HEAD.

### Notes for whoever runs this next

* `pidstat` is not installed on this host; `/proc`-based samplers were written
  instead (`measure.py`, `threads.py`, `frames.py`, `gaps.py`, `whichframe.py`,
  all under `/tmp/ns-audit/`). None is committed — they are scratch instruments,
  not deliverables.
* `apps/desktop/linux/CMakeLists.txt` looks for the bridge at
  `native/nightshade_native/target/release/`, NOT at `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`. A fresh
  worktree needs that path to exist or `flutter build linux` fails with "Rust
  library not found".
* Driving the app on the owner's desktop is not possible with `xdotool`: the
  session is Wayland (`XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland`) and the window does not
  enumerate. The real-display numbers above are therefore for the Tonight screen
  only, which is where the app launches.

---

# Addendum — renderer experiment (Skia vs Impeller) and the clock experiment

Requested after the audit above. **Protocol correction first:** an earlier
attempt drove the `:0` instance with `xdotool` to reach the Sequencer and
Imaging screens, and that blacked out the owner's desktop until the instance was
killed. Everything below therefore obeys stricter rules, which any future agent
should treat as binding:

* **No synthetic input to `:0`, ever.** A `:0` instance is passive measurement
  only — VM-service reads. No `xdotool`, no key/mouse, no window resize/raise.
* **No screenshots of `:0`.**
* **Exactly one `:0` instance at a time**, scratch `NIGHTSHADE_DATABASE_DIR`,
  killed by pid with `/proc/<pid>` verification. `/tmp/ns-audit/run_real.sh`
  refuses to launch while any previous instance's pid is still alive.
* The owner's preview (pid 2184559, `~/.cache/nightshade-ledger-preview`) was
  verified alive and untouched after every single run.

Because interaction is not allowed on `:0`, all three measurements are **idle on
the Tonight screen** — the screen the app opens on — at the app's **default
1600x900 window**, not maximised. Scroll and screen-switch numbers stay in the
harness (section 6) as an upper bound.

> Correction to section 4: those earlier `:0` numbers were also taken at the
> default 1600x900 window, not the full 5120x1440. The conclusion is unchanged
> but the window size should be read with them.

## Is Impeller available on Linux in this SDK? Yes.

Evidence, three independent sources:

1. `flutter_tools/lib/src/desktop_device.dart:297-302` emits the engine switch
   for desktop devices, and the Linux **default is off**:
   ```dart
   switch (debuggingOptions.enableImpeller) {
     case ImpellerStatus.enabled:          addFlag('enable-impeller=true');
     case ImpellerStatus.disabled:
     case ImpellerStatus.platformDefault:  addFlag('enable-impeller=false');
   }
   ```
2. `addFlag` (`desktop_device.dart:247`) writes `FLUTTER_ENGINE_SWITCH_<n>`, the
   same env mechanism used throughout this audit — **no rebuild required**.
3. The shipped engine has Impeller compiled in: `strings libflutter_linux_gtk.so
   | grep -ci impeller` → **127**, including `CreateImpellerContext`,
   `impeller-backend`, `impeller-lazy-shader-mode`.

Confirmed at runtime — with `FLUTTER_ENGINE_SWITCH_3="enable-impeller=true"` the
app logs:

```
[IMPORTANT:...embedder_surface_gl_impeller.cc(124)] Using the Impeller rendering backend (OpenGL).
```

Note **OpenGL**, not Vulkan — see the host finding below.

## The three measurements (all: `:0`, Tonight, idle, 60 s, default window)

| | (a) current (Skia) | (b) Impeller — first 60 s | (b2) Impeller — warmed 60 s | (c) seconds removed | (c2) seconds removed + LST at minute resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| frames/second | 1.6 | 1.6 | 1.7 | 1.6 | 1.6 |
| build p50 | **0.68 ms** | 0.90 ms | 0.68 ms | 0.47 ms | **0.14 ms** |
| build p90 | 1.12 ms | 2.84 ms | 1.30 ms | 0.86 ms | 0.72 ms |
| raster p50 | **4.39 ms** | 6.46 ms | 5.07 ms | 5.18 ms | 4.66 ms |
| raster p90 | **7.41 ms** | 21.54 ms | **30.98 ms** | 10.49 ms | **5.52 ms** |
| total p50 | **6.93 ms** | 9.60 ms | 7.72 ms | 7.24 ms | **6.43 ms** |
| total p90 | **10.73 ms** | 29.50 ms | **38.43 ms** | 12.79 ms | **7.33 ms** |
| frames > 16.67 ms | 5% | 25% | 16% | 1% | 1% |
| idle CPU (30 s) | **10.83%** | 11.93% | — | — | **10.70%** |
| RSS | 131.6 MB | 139.5 MB | — | — | — |

### (b) Impeller is worse here, and the tail is what kills it

Impeller loses at the median (raster 5.07 vs 4.39 ms warmed) and loses badly at
p90 — **30.98 ms vs 7.41 ms, 4.2x worse** — with 16% of idle frames over 16.67 ms
against Skia's 5%. Idle CPU is also slightly higher (11.93% vs 10.83%). Warming
does not rescue it: the second 60 s window has a *worse* raster p90 than the
first. On a 4.17 ms budget this is the wrong direction.

### Impeller renders the app correctly (harness `:9x`, never `:0`)

Identical drive sequence under both renderers on a private Xvfb at `:93`,
1920x1200, full-resolution captures, then `magick compare`:

| screen | differing pixels | fraction | RMSE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tonight | 8 854 / 2 304 000 | 0.38% | 0.0347 |
| Sequencer ledger | 10 606 / 2 304 000 | 0.46% | 0.0360 |
| Imaging | 5 801 / 2 304 000 | 0.25% | 0.0270 |

By eye, at full resolution: **no artifacts**. Layout, colours, gradients, the
twilight band, the ledger gutter strip, icons, the Imaging star field and
histogram all render identically. The diff mask shows the differences spread
thinly over *every glyph* — text antialiasing, which is the expected Skia↔Impeller
difference — plus a few solid blocks that are **app state, not rendering**: the
two runs differed in guider connection (`Ready` vs `No guider`), the preflight
badge count, and the status-bar clock digits. Impeller is correct; it is just
slower on this machine.

### (c) Removing the seconds digit buys nothing — and section 8's recommendation was wrong

This is the most important correction in this addendum. Dropping `:ss` **and**
slowing the chip's own ticker to one minute left the idle frame rate completely
unchanged at 1.6/s. Per-frame source tracing says why: `_TimeDisplay` was still
rebuilding at exactly 1 Hz, because it also does

```dart
final lst = siteIsSet ? ref.watch(localSiderealTimeProvider) : null;
```

and `localSiderealTimeProvider` (`catalog_astronomy.dart:304`) is a **double**
derived from `wallClockProvider`, a 1 Hz `AlignedTicker`. The chip renders LST as
`HH:mm` (`formatLstChip` floors to the minute) but watched a value that changes
**60x per displayed change**. The seconds digit was never the 1 Hz source; the
LST chip was.

With both changed (c2) — seconds gone, and the LST watched through
`.select((h) => (h * 60).floor())`, its own display resolution — the clock leaves
the idle path entirely: **build p50 0.68 → 0.14 ms, raster p90 7.41 → 5.52 ms,
total p90 10.73 → 7.33 ms.** Per-source tracing confirms `_TimeDisplay` no longer
appears at 1 Hz, and the remaining idle sources on Tonight are only:

* `TonightEquipmentPanel` / `DeviceRow` / `Readout` every **2 s** — the mount
  position poll, which that panel legitimately displays;
* `_SaveFolderPill` every **10 s** — the disk-space poll (`disk_space_provider.dart:66`);
* the twilight `NightBand` `CustomPaint`, occasionally.

**But idle CPU did not move: 10.83% → 10.70%, inside the noise.** The remaining
0.5 Hz mount frame costs a full-window repaint on its own, so removing the 1 Hz
one halves the frame count without halving the cost of being idle.

## Host finding that dwarfs the renderer question

> **Corrected.** An earlier revision of this section claimed the panel was on the
> integrated GPU. That was wrong — I inverted the card numbering by reading it off
> `lspci` bus order instead of the DRM nodes. The verified mapping is below.

```
/sys/class/drm/card0  ->  vendor 0x1002 device 0x164e  driver amdgpu   (AMD Raphael iGPU)
/sys/class/drm/card1  ->  vendor 0x10de device 0x2704  driver nvidia   (GeForce RTX 4080)
connected output      ->  card1-HDMI-A-1               (i.e. the panel IS on the RTX 4080)

/proc/driver/nvidia/version -> NVIDIA Open Kernel Module 610.57.04  (loaded)
pacman -Q                   -> nvidia-utils 615.71.09-1
                               linux-cachyos-nvidia-open 7.2.4-1
uname -r                    -> 7.2.3-1-cachyos          uptime -p -> up 6 days
nvidia-smi                  -> Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch
vulkaninfo --summary        -> GPU0 only: INTEGRATED_GPU, RADV RAPHAEL_MENDOCINO
```

**The 5120x1440 240 Hz panel is on the RTX 4080. What is broken is the driver
stack around it.** `nvidia-utils` was upgraded to 615.71 on 2026-09-12 alongside
`linux-cachyos-nvidia-open` for kernel 7.2.4, but the machine has been up six
days on kernel **7.2.3** with the **610.57** module still loaded. That version
skew is what `nvidia-smi`'s NVML mismatch reports, and it is why `vulkaninfo`
enumerates only the iGPU: the 615.71 NVIDIA Vulkan userspace cannot talk to a
610.57 kernel module. It is also why Impeller fell back to its OpenGL backend
instead of Vulkan.

So every raster figure in this report is **NVIDIA GL running on a mismatched
driver stack** — not an iGPU figure, and not a fair reading of what this hardware
can do either. Re-measuring after a reboot into the matching driver is the first
thing to do with any of these numbers.

## Recommendation

**Do not enable Impeller, and do not remove the seconds digit — neither is worth
shipping, and the numbers say so plainly**: Impeller costs 4.2x the raster p90
(30.98 ms vs 7.41 ms) with three times as many missed frames and no correctness
benefit, while the clock change moves idle CPU by 0.13 points, which is noise.
The one genuinely mis-specified thing the experiment did uncover is the LST chip
watching a 1 Hz double to render a `HH:mm` string — worth fixing on its own
merits (it takes the clock out of the idle path entirely: build p50 0.68 → 0.14 ms,
total p90 10.73 → 7.33 ms) but, on its own, not something the owner will feel.
What the owner will feel is the host: his 240 Hz ultrawide is on the RTX 4080,
but the box has been up six days on kernel 7.2.3 with the 610.57 NVIDIA module
loaded while 615.71 userspace is installed — so every number here was taken on a
mismatched driver stack that Vulkan cannot even enumerate. A reboot into the
matching driver and a re-measure is a bigger single lever than any renderer or
widget change in this report, and it costs nothing to try first. After that, the app-side work that
actually pays is what section 5 started: `RepaintBoundary` coverage on the heavy
screens, because with no damage region in the Linux embedder every idle tick
repaints the whole window, and the cheapest frame is the one that repaints least.
