// Two reasons this runs AFTER the fix waves and a rebuild, not before:
//  * a finding that a fix has already closed must come back REFUTED, and it only
//    can if the binary under test contains the fix;
//  * the P0/P1 pass showed 21 of 55 findings cited the WRONG file:line even when
//    the symptom was real, so "where" is not trustworthy input to a fixer until
//    somebody has checked it.

const BRIEF = `
# YOU ARE AN ADVERSARIAL VERIFIER. DEFAULT TO REFUTED.

Assume each claim is wrong until you reproduce it yourself in the running app. On the P0/P1 pass
9% of findings were refuted outright and 38% cited a file:line that did not contain what was
claimed — and a wrong location is WORSE than a false positive, because it sends a fixer into
unrelated code. So check the location too, not just the symptom.

The bundle you are driving was REBUILT after several fix waves. A finding that has since been fixed
must come back REFUTED with a note saying so — that is a correct and useful result, not a failure.

Per finding, return exactly one verdict:
  CONFIRMED — you reproduced it yourself
  REFUTED   — it does not reproduce, the code does not say that, the reasoning does not hold, or it
              has already been fixed
  UNCLEAR   — you could not reach it; say precisely what blocked you. Not a hedge for "probably
              real".
Also correct the severity if it is wrong in either direction, and flag a wrong "where".

# HOW TO DRIVE
Read tools/ui_audit/README.md. The release bundle is ALREADY BUILT — do NOT run flutter build or
cargo build; other agents share this machine.

  env NS_AUDIT_DISPLAY=<DISPLAY> python3 tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py start --profile <PROFILE> --fresh
  env NS_AUDIT_DISPLAY=<DISPLAY> python3 tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py tree
  env NS_AUDIT_DISPLAY=<DISPLAY> python3 tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py shot /tmp/ns-audit/shots/<PROFILE>-NN.png
  env NS_AUDIT_DISPLAY=<DISPLAY> python3 tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py click-img <that shot> X Y
  env NS_AUDIT_DISPLAY=<DISPLAY> python3 tools/ui_audit/drive_linux.py stop --profile <PROFILE>

CONTEXT BUDGET — this is what killed four agents earlier: a screenshot costs ~2000 tokens and one
agent read 140. Use \`tree\` (text, nearly free) for state; screenshot only for layout or rendering
questions. Budget ~30 image reads for the whole batch. \`click-img\` takes coordinates AS MEASURED IN
THAT IMAGE; \`click-xy\` takes root coordinates and would land elsewhere.

For any finding about a NUMBER, recompute it yourself from the scratch DB
(/tmp/ns-audit/<PROFILE>/data/nightshade.db) or by hand. Comparing two of the app's own readouts
proves nothing about which is right.

WRITE AS YOU GO: append each verdict to reports/coverage/verdicts/<YOUR KEY>.json the moment you
decide it. Agents here have died mid-report and that file is what survives.
