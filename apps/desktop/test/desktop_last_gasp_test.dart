// A desktop GUI that dies with devices connected must not leave nothing
// behind — no shutdown record, no safed device, a log whose last line is an
// unrelated warning. An unattended imager must never end that quietly.
//
// These tests pin the death path itself, independently of whatever triggers
// it:
//   * the record is on disk BEFORE any device command is sent, because a safing
//     call that hangs must still leave evidence;
//   * safing runs, is time-bounded, and a failure to park never stops the
//     process from ending;
//   * a repeated stop signal is an escape hatch, not a no-op;
//   * a session that just vanishes leaves a `running` record naming the last
//     error it saw, so the NEXT launch can say so.
