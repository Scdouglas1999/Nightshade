// Regression: the headless server must actually INJECT its CommandCorrelator
// into the handlers that register commands.
//
// `HeadlessApiServer` built its correlator, exposed it, and swept it on a timer,
// and `_stampEventForBroadcast` was ready to stamp outgoing events — but
// `_initializeHandlers()` constructed `DeviceHandlers(container, ...)` and
// `SequencerHandlers(container)` without passing it. `commandCorrelator` is an
// optional named parameter and every call site guards with
// `commandCorrelator?.beginCommand(...)`, so the omission failed silently and in
// the pass-making direction: action POSTs returned no `commandId`, every emitted
// event carried `correlatingCommandId: null`, nothing threw, and the whole
// correlation feature advertised by /api/docs was dead.
//
// Crucially, the existing unit tests over `commandCompletionEventTypes`
// (command_correlator_test.dart) could NOT catch this: that table was always
// correct, it was simply never consulted with a registered command. So this test
// asserts the WIRING rather than the table — it observes the injected
// correlator's own `pendingCount`, which only moves if a handler really called
// `beginCommand`.
