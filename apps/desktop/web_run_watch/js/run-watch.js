/*
 * Nightshade Run-Watch — phone/tablet web client.
 *
 * Vanilla JS so the bundle stays tiny. Three concerns:
 *
 *  1. Credentials — three, in this order, because a browser already signed in
 *     to /dashboard/ on this origin must not be asked to authenticate twice:
 *       - this device's own pairing, in localStorage;
 *       - the bearer the dashboard left in this TAB's sessionStorage, adopted
 *         in memory and never persisted here;
 *       - the HttpOnly session cookie, confirmed by GET /api/auth/csrf and
 *         carried by the browser itself.
 *     With none of the three, the pairing wall: request a WORD-WORD-NNNN code
 *     via /api/pairing/start (which puts it on the rig, never on the wire —
 *     see PairingHandlers), read it off the rig, /api/pairing/verify.
 *
 *  2. Live data — once authenticated:
 *       - fetch /api/run-watch/snapshot every 15s as a baseline, on reconnect,
 *         and on every frame event so the frame counter keeps step with the
 *         feed rendered beside it,
 *       - subscribe to /api/run-watch/events (SSE) for the firehose,
 *       - poll /api/run-watch/frame-thumbnail when a FrameAccepted /
 *         ExposureFinished event arrives, plus every 10s as a fallback
 *         so the panel never goes stale.
 *
 *  3. Controls — POST to existing /api/sequencer/{pause,resume,skip,stop}
 *     so we don't duplicate any backend logic.
