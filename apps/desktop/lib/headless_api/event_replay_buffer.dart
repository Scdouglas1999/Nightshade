// monotonic event sequencing + ring-buffer replay for the headless
// API server.
//
// Every NightshadeEvent broadcast by HeadlessApiServer is stamped with a
// monotonically-increasing `seq` and the server-instance UUID, then
// appended to this ring buffer. WebSocket clients reconnecting with
// `?since=<seq>&instance=<uuid>` can be replayed everything they missed,
// or told `resync_required` if the gap is too large.
//
// The buffer is in-memory only — a server restart issues a new
// `serverInstanceId` so clients know their cached `seq` is stale.
