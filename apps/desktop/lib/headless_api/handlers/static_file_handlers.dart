/// Owns the two top-level static-file surfaces shipped inside the
/// Nightshade executable so a headless deployment (Pi / embedded host /
/// remote ops) can serve them without an external web server:
///   * `/dashboard` — the desktop control dashboard. Sourced from
///     `web_dashboard/`.
///   * `/run-watch` — the mobile-first run-watch SPA + PWA. Sourced
///     from `web_run_watch/`.
///
/// Both surfaces share the same resolver heuristic (next to the
/// executable, inside `data/flutter_assets/`, walking up the source
/// tree, and finally relative to CWD) so a developer build and a
/// shipped installer behave the same way. Directory traversal is
/// blocked via [_normalizeRelative] + a post-resolve symlink check.
///
/// Both prefixes are served WITHOUT a credential, so what they expose is not
/// "whatever is in the directory" but the pages' own asset kinds: [_mimeTypes]
/// is the allowlist and anything outside it is refused before the disk is
/// touched.
///
/// The bundled run-watch service worker (`sw.js`) gets a longer
/// `Service-Worker-Allowed: /run-watch/` response header so it can
/// claim the parent scope cleanly during registration; every other
/// asset is served with `cache-control: no-cache` so SPA updates ship
/// instantly without per-asset cache busting.
