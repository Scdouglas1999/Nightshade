// command/event correlation for the headless API server.
//
// Every action POST (camera/expose, mount/slew, sequencer/start, etc.)
// generates a UUID v4 commandId, registers (operation, deviceId,
// commandId) with the correlator, and includes the id in its response.
// When the backend later emits a NightshadeEvent that "completes" the
// command, broadcastEvent calls [stampEvent] which best-effort matches
// the event back to the most recent un-correlated command for that
// (operation, deviceId) pair and copies the commandId onto the event
// as `correlatingCommandId`.
//
// The matching is intentionally best-effort: a multi-client scenario
// where two phones slew the same mount within 100 ms can confuse the
// FIFO pairing. We document that limitation in the class doc rather
// than building a deterministic command-id round-trip through the FFI
// layer (which would require Rust-side support and is out of scope for
// this wave).
//
// TTL eviction (default 30 minutes) protects against unbounded growth
// when a registered command's matching event never arrives (e.g. driver
// hang, sequence cancelled before completion).
