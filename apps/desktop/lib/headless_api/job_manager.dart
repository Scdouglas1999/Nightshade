// job model for long-running headless operations.
//
// The audit's §6 finding (docs/audits/headless_2026_05_24/02-device-control.md)
// was that autofocus, plate-solve, center-on-target, mosaic plan, and polar
// alignment hold an HTTP connection open for the entire run. A client-side
// 30s timeout (or an OS-level background TCP teardown on mobile) kills the
// connection while the server-side op continues unobserved — there is no
// job handle to re-query, no way for a second client to cancel the run.
//
// This module fixes that by making long-running ops register as `Job`s
// owned by a `JobManager`. The action POST returns `{jobId, status: queued}`
// immediately; progress and completion flow through the existing
// WebSocket event stream as `NightshadeEvent` with `category: job`. The
// REST surface gains `GET /api/jobs/{jobId}`, `GET /api/jobs`,
// `POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/cancel`, and `DELETE /api/jobs/{jobId}`.
//
// State is in-memory only. Jobs older than 24 hours are purged by a
// periodic sweep. Persistence across restart is documented as a future
// enhancement; mobile clients should treat a `serverInstanceId` change as
// a signal to abandon their cached job ids.
