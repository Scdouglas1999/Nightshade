/// API server has started, BEFORE the daemon prints its "running" banner.

/// Contract:
///   * Uses the daemon's existing [ProviderContainer] and the same
///     [ProfileService.autoConnectOnStartup] core as the GUI, so selection /
///     activation / connect semantics are identical across surfaces.
///   * Gates on [FfiBackend] so a misconfiguration can never make the daemon
///     drive a remote host.
///   * Failure MUST NOT crash-loop the daemon: a single offline device, or a
///     total activation failure, is logged and printed to stderr while the
///     server keeps running so the operator can recover remotely.
///   * [backendReady] is the `useLocalBackend()` FfiBackend-swap future,
///     awaited INSIDE this fail-soft seam so a readiness failure is logged and
///     swallowed here rather than escaping to `main_headless`'s outer catch,
///     which would tear the already-started server down and exit. When null
///     (a caller that pre-installs a backend) the readiness step is skipped.
