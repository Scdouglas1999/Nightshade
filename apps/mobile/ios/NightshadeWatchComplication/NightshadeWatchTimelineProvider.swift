// NightshadeWatchTimelineProvider.swift
//
// Wave 7D — WidgetKit TimelineProvider for the Nightshade watch
// complication.
//
// Data path:
//   1. The iOS host app (Flutter side) writes a JSON snapshot to the App
//      Group container (`group.com.nightshade.app`) under the key
//      `watch_complication_snapshot` every time material sequence /
//      weather state changes. See
//      `apps/mobile/lib/services/watch_complication_service.dart`.
//   2. The host then calls `WidgetCenter.shared.reloadAllTimelines()` via
//      the `nightshade/watch_complication` MethodChannel. WidgetKit calls
//      `getTimeline(...)` on this provider.
//   3. We read the snapshot, decode it, and emit a single-entry timeline.
//      The timeline ends with `policy = .after(now + 60s)` so the system
//      still polls us in the background even if the app is suspended and
//      cannot call `reloadAllTimelines()` — without that fallback a
//      sequence that runs unattended for hours would leave a stale face.
//
// Why a single-entry timeline (rather than projecting future entries):
// progress is event-driven by the imaging rig. We have no way to predict
// when the next frame will land — exposure time, dithering, autofocus
// runs, weather pauses all warp it. Emitting projected entries would
// invariably be wrong. The 60s `.after(...)` policy gives WidgetKit a
// floor to come back and check the snapshot ourselves; the host's
// reload trigger is the fast path.
