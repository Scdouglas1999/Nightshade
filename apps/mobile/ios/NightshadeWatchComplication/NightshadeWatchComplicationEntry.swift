// NightshadeWatchComplicationEntry.swift
//
// Apple Watch complication for Nightshade.
//
// `NightshadeWatchComplicationEntry` is the `TimelineEntry` consumed by the
// WidgetKit timeline provider in `NightshadeWatchTimelineProvider.swift`.
// One entry is one point-in-time snapshot of the sequencer + weather state
// that will be rendered into a complication face.
//
// The host iOS app writes a JSON snapshot to the shared App Group container
// (`group.com.nightshade.app`) every time something material changes in the
// running sequence — sequence progress, filter swap, weather safety alert,
// etc. The provider here reads that snapshot and lifts it into a typed
// `Entry` so the SwiftUI views can branch off concrete properties rather
// than parse JSON in the body of a `View`.
//
// JSON keys MUST match the Dart side in
// `apps/mobile/lib/services/watch_complication_service.dart`. Touch them
// only in lockstep.
