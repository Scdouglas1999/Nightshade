// NightshadeLiveActivityAttributes.swift
//
// iOS Live Activities for unattended sequence progress.
//
// `ActivityAttributes` defines the static metadata (`sequenceId`,
// `targetName`, `totalFrames`) that is fixed for the duration of a single
// activity, together with the dynamic `ContentState` that the host app
// pushes via `Activity.update(...)` whenever progress changes.
//
// The host (Flutter) side serialises both halves as JSON over the
// `com.nightshade.live_activity` MethodChannel and the Swift channel
// handler reconstructs the typed values before requesting / updating an
// activity. Field names MUST be kept in sync with
// `apps/mobile/lib/services/live_activity_service.dart` — the JSON keys
// are the source of truth between the two layers.
