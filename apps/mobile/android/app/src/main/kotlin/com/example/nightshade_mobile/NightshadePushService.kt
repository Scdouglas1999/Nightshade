/**
 * FCM service entry points.
 *
 * Displaying a background push needs no code here: the host sends a
 * `notification` payload targeting the `nightshade_critical` channel
 * (created by [PushBridge]), which Android renders automatically while the
 * app is backgrounded or dead — the exact situation FCM exists for.
 *
 * Foreground messages are deliberately NOT re-surfaced as notifications:
 * on-LAN the UDP receiver (lan_push_notification_receiver.dart) already
 * alerts in the foreground, so rendering the FCM copy would double-notify.
 * This mirrors iOS, where foreground APNs banners are likewise suppressed.
