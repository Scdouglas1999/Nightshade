// Wave 6D P2-14 — Battery-aware mobile throttling.
//
// PowerService already exists for low-battery *warning* surfaces (notification
// pop, wake-lock release at critical thresholds). BatteryService is the
// *throttling* peer: it exposes a Riverpod-friendly stream of {level,
// isCharging, isLowPower} samples that polling providers consume to decide
// how often to hit the network.
//
// Two services rather than one because:
//   * PowerService is a behaviour engine (acquires wake locks, posts
//     notifications, gates imaging). Mixing display state into it would
//     couple every consumer that just wants the percentage to the full
//     wake-lock + notification pipeline.
//   * BatteryService is purely a *projection* of the battery_plus stream
//     into a typed snapshot. It is allowed to be a singleton because the
//     OS only has one battery; we initialize once at app start and let
//     every consumer subscribe to the broadcast stream.
//
// The stream is event-driven: battery_plus emits a [BatteryState] change
// whenever the OS reports plug/unplug, and we additionally tick every 30 s
// to recompute the percentage (battery_plus doesn't push level changes on
// every percent). The 30 s cadence matches PowerService's own check
// interval so both services see the same level reading; we don't share
// the underlying [Battery] instance because that's a cheap object and
// sharing would mean PowerService.dispose() could kill our subscriptions.
