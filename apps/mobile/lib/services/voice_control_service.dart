// Voice Control Service
//
// Bridges the running sequence state to platform-native voice assistants:
//
//   * iOS: Siri Shortcuts / AppIntents (iOS 16+). The App Intents extension
//     reads a JSON snapshot from a shared App Group UserDefaults suite each
//     time Siri asks "What's Nightshade doing?". Control intents
//     (pause/resume) come back to Dart through the same MethodChannel as an
//     inbound action.
//
//   * Android: App Actions / Assistant Shortcuts. The ShortcutManagerCompat
//     "dynamic shortcut" carrying the latest snapshot is pushed each time
//     Dart calls `publishSequenceStatus`. When Assistant dispatches one of
//     the shortcuts back to the app, MainActivity decodes the intent and
//     forwards it through the channel as an inbound action.
//
// JSON keys here are the source of truth for both sides. Touch them only
// in lockstep with `apps/mobile/ios/NightshadeAppIntents/*.swift` and
// `apps/mobile/android/app/src/main/kotlin/.../MainActivity.kt`.
//
// Every PlatformException from the host bridge propagates, and an unsupported
// platform throws a typed exception, so a caller never believes it published a
// snapshot the assistant will never see.
