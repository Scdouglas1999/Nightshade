// Multi-server roaming on the mobile companion.
//
// Persists a list of previously-paired Nightshade hosts so an operator
// who manages multiple rigs (e.g. observatory + travel scope + backyard
// pier) can roam between them without re-pairing each time.
//
// Why a dedicated service (rather than just extending
// EnhancedNightshadeDiscovery): the existing discovery layer was built
// around a single "last server" slot — host/port/auth-token/fingerprint
// pairs all share one SharedPreferences key set. Adding multi-server
// support there would force every consumer to either accept a list
// signature or pick an index, breaking the QR/manual-entry seam.
// Keeping the multi-server list separate means:
//
//   1. The new `SavedServersService` is a pure data store; it does not
//      drive backend connections directly.
//   2. The screen calls `EnhancedNightshadeDiscovery.saveLastServer`
//      after connect succeeds, then `SavedServersService.upsert` to
//      mirror the same record into the roaming list. Existing callers
//      that read `loadLastServer()` (auto-reconnect on startup, LAN push
//      receiver) keep working without changes.
//   3. Migration is one-way: on first read of `SavedServersService` we
//      look at `loadLastServer()` and ensure its record exists in the
//      list. Removing a saved server only removes it from the list — the
//      "current/last" slot stays untouched until the user explicitly
//      disconnects.
//
// Auth tokens are sensitive — the desktop's PairingService issues bearer
// tokens that are equivalent to a password against the headless API.
// They are persisted exclusively in `flutter_secure_storage` (Keychain /
// EncryptedSharedPreferences), keyed by the saved-server `id`. The
// non-secret rows (display name, host, port, fingerprint, timestamps,
// notes) live in SharedPreferences as a single JSON blob so they survive
// cheap reads on cold start without touching Keychain.
