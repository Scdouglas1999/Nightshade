// Losing the host must not be terminal.
//
// When the network drops, the app tears the session down after the 30 s grace
// period and shows "Connection to server lost. Please reconnect." Getting back
// from there is the retry path's job: the grace timer's callback is otherwise
// the end of the line, and the app sits on that screen even once the network
// returns — a cold start reconnects instantly from the same saved server and
// token, so the credentials are never what is missing.
//
// The retry path re-arms the same `_autoConnect()` entry point a cold start
// uses, on the backoff pinned below. These cases lock the schedule's shape: it
// must ramp (so a blip recovers in seconds), it must cap (so it never
// busy-polls), and it must never terminate (so an overnight outage still
// re-attaches).
