//! PSF estimation and regularized Richardson–Lucy deconvolution (preview).
//!
//! Deconvolution sharpens an image by partially inverting the blur introduced
//! by the atmosphere, the optics, and the guiding system — all of which combine
//! into a single *point-spread function* (PSF). If `o` is the true sky, `h` the
//! PSF, and `n` photon/read noise, a linear-light frame is
//!
//! ```text
//!     i = (o * h) + n            ( "*" is 2-D convolution )
//! ```
//!
//! and deconvolution estimates `o` from `i` given an estimate of `h`. The
//! classic, well-behaved estimator for Poisson-dominated astronomical data is
//! **Richardson–Lucy** (RL): an expectation-maximization iteration that is
//! non-negative by construction and conserves total flux, which is exactly the
//! behaviour we want for a *preview* — we must not invent or destroy signal.
//!
//! This module provides the two halves of a deconvolution pipeline:
//!
//! 1. [`estimate_psf`] — derive a PSF *from the image itself* by stacking the
//!    cores of well-behaved (unsaturated, round, mid-bright) stars. The stars
//!    in a frame are physical samples of the PSF, so a robust median of their
//!    normalized cores is an empirical PSF. Optionally we fit an analytic
//!    Moffat or Gaussian to the median radial profile instead, which denoises
//!    the kernel at the cost of assuming a parametric shape.
//!
//! 2. [`richardson_lucy`] — run a bounded number of RL iterations per channel
//!    on the **linear** image, with optional total-variation regularization to
//!    damp the noise amplification RL is famous for, and an optional
//!    star-core protection clamp to suppress the dark ringing that RL produces
//!    around saturated cores.
//!
//! ## Why this is a *preview*, not a science product
//!
//! Deconvolution is ill-posed: small high-frequency errors in the PSF or the
//! data are amplified every iteration. A trustworthy science deconvolution
//! needs an accurate, possibly spatially-varying PSF and careful per-object
//! regularization. Here we deliberately bound the iteration count, regularize,
//! and operate on a single average PSF — enough to give the user a faithful
//! "what would sharpening do?" preview without over-claiming.
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//!
//! The defaults ([`DeconvConfig::default`], [`PsfEstimateConfig::default`]) —
//! 30 iterations, a small TV damping factor, an 80-star / 25-px estimation
//! budget — are *defensible engineering defaults*, not values tuned against a
//! corpus of real frames. They are exposed as knobs precisely so they can be
//! revisited with real data. The algorithms themselves (median PSF stacking,
//! Levenberg-free 1-D profile fit by coarse-then-fine search, the standard RL
//! multiplicative update, TV damping) are deterministic and unit-tested on
//! synthetic frames at the bottom of this file.

/// The RL iteration on a single channel is
///
/// ```text
///     u_{k+1} = u_k · [ ĥ * ( i / (h * u_k) ) ]
/// ```
///
/// where `h` is the PSF, `ĥ` is the PSF flipped 180°, `i` is the observed
/// (linear) image, and `u_0 = i`. Each factor is non-negative, so `u_k` stays
/// non-negative; because `∑h = 1` and the update is multiplicative, total flux
/// is (to numerical precision) conserved — exactly what a faithful preview
/// requires.
///
/// Two optional modifications:
/// * **TV regularization** (`cfg.regularization > 0`): the update factor is
///   divided by `1 + λ·|∇u_k|/u_k`, which is the standard total-variation /
///   "RL-TV" damping. It throttles the update where the local gradient is large
///   relative to the signal (noise, ringing) and is ~neutral on smooth signal,
///   trading a little resolution for a large reduction in noise amplification.
/// * **Star protection** (`cfg.star_protect`): pixels at/above the saturation
///   level are not allowed to *increase*, which removes the dark ring RL paints
///   around clipped cores.

/// The output is a new linear `ImageData` of the **same dimensions, channel
