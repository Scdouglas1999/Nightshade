//! Photometric color calibration — per-channel white balance solve + apply (Pillar 3a).
//!
//! This is the native half of an SPCC-style ("Spectrophotometric Color
//! Calibration", as popularised by PixInsight) colour calibration. The
//! catalogue cross-match — turning detected stars into entries with a known
//! photometric colour index `B − V` — happens in Dart against a star catalogue.
//! What this module does is the *photometry-driven* part: given a set of
//! matched stars, each carrying its measured background-subtracted flux in
//! every image channel and its catalogue `B − V`, it solves the per-channel
//! scale factors that render a chosen reference-colour star neutral, then
//! applies those scales to the image.
//!
//! ## Why a colour-vs-flux fit and not a simple ratio
//!
//! A single white star would, in principle, give you the channel balance
//! directly: scale each channel so that star reads equal across channels. In
//! practice a single star is a terrible estimator — it may be a blend, slightly
//! saturated, sitting on a gradient, or simply mismeasured. The robust answer
//! is to use the *whole population* of matched stars, which span a range of
//! colours, and fit the channel response as a function of colour:
//!
//! ```text
//!     log10(flux_c) = a_c + b_c · (B − V)        (per channel c)
//! ```
//!
//! The instrument's channel response is, to first order, an affine function of
//! colour index in log-flux space (a star that is redder by Δ(B−V) is fainter
//! in blue and brighter in red by a roughly fixed number of magnitudes, and a
//! magnitude *is* a log-flux). Fitting a line through every matched star and
//! then evaluating it at the reference colour `B − V = white_ref_bv` gives the
//! flux a reference-colour star *would* read in each channel; the inverse of
//! that flux is the scale that neutralises it. Using the fit rather than a raw
//! average means a handful of blends or outliers cannot move the answer.
//!
//! ## Robust fit
//!
//! The line is fit with a **Theil–Sen** estimator (the median of all pairwise
//! slopes) followed by a median-based intercept, then **one IRLS-style
//! refinement** pass that down-weights points by their residual using Tukey's
//! biweight. Theil–Sen has a ~29.3% breakdown point — it tolerates a large
//! fraction of gross outliers (blends, mismatched catalogue rows, cosmic-ray
//! contaminated stars) that would wreck an ordinary least-squares slope. This
//! is the standard robust-regression choice when the contamination is in the
//! response variable and the predictor is low-dimensional, which is exactly the
//! `flux` vs `B−V` situation here. The reported [`ColorCalibration::residual`]
//! is the robust RMS (MAD-scaled) of the per-channel fit residuals.
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//!
//! * `white_ref_bv` defaults (at the call site) to ≈ 0.65, the `B − V` of a G2V
//!   star (the Sun) — the conventional "white" reference for daylight-balanced
//!   colour. This is a *defensible convention*, not a corpus-tuned constant; a
//!   user targeting a different white point (e.g. average-spiral-galaxy or a
//!   D50/D65 photometric white) should pass their own value.
//! * [`MIN_MATCHED_STARS`] = 8 is a sanity floor, not a statistically derived
//!   minimum. Below it the per-channel line is too poorly constrained to trust;
//!   it is exposed as a named constant so it can be revisited.
//! * The affine-in-log model captures the first-order channel response. It does
//!   *not* model second-order colour terms, extinction, or per-star atmospheric
//!   reddening — those belong to a full spectrophotometric pipeline and are out
//!   of scope for this white-balance step.
//!
//! The catalogue cross-match, the spectral/transmission database, and the
//! choice of which stars to feed in all live in Dart; this module is the
//! deterministic, unit-tested numeric core.
