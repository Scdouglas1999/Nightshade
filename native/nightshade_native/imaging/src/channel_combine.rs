//! Narrowband palette channel combination — SHO / HOO / custom.
//!
//! Narrowband imaging captures a target through one bandpass at a time (Hα at
//! 656.3 nm, [O III] at 500.7 nm, [S II] at 671.6 nm, …), integrating each
//! emission line into its own monochrome master. To produce a colour image
//! those single-channel masters must be mapped — by a fixed linear recipe — onto
//! the red, green, and blue display channels. The choice of recipe is the
//! *palette*:
//!
//! - **SHO** ("Hubble palette"): `S II → R`, `Hα → G`, `O III → B`. The classic
//!   false-colour mapping popularised by the Hubble Space Telescope team.
//! - **HOO** ("bicolour"): `Hα → R`, `O III → G` *and* `B`. Two channels only;
//!   O III drives both the green and the blue, giving the teal/gold look that
//!   approximates a natural-ish rendition of an emission nebula.
//!
//! This module implements the underlying primitive both palettes share: a
//! **linear combination** of any number of single-channel masters into a
//! 3-channel (RGB) composite, where each input contributes a per-channel
//! weight triple `[r, g, b]`. SHO and HOO are then just two named weight
//! tables ([`sho_palette`], [`hoo_palette`]); arbitrary custom palettes are
//! expressed by passing your own weights to [`combine_channels`].
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! For inputs `I_0 … I_{n-1}` (each a single-channel linear master with
//! identical dimensions) and weights `W_0 … W_{n-1}` (each a `[r, g, b]`
//! triple), the output composite is, per pixel `p`:
//!
//! ```text
//! R(p) = Σ_i W_i[0] · I_i(p)
//! G(p) = Σ_i W_i[1] · I_i(p)
//! B(p) = Σ_i W_i[2] · I_i(p)
//! ```
//!
//! This is the standard "channel mixer" / palette-combination operation used by
//! PixInsight's `PixelMath` and `ChannelCombination` and by Siril's `pm`
//! expressions: a fixed linear map from line-masters to display primaries. The
//! accumulation is done in `f64` (so that many inputs, or weights outside
//! `[0, 1]`, do not lose precision) and the result is stored as a linear `F32`
//! RGB master — unquantised, ready for further post-processing (SCNR, stretch).
//!
//! The work is embarrassingly parallel over output rows; we parallelise with
//! `rayon` over disjoint row slices exactly like
//! [`crate::integration`]/[`crate::calibration`].
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//!
//! - The combine is purely **linear and per-pixel**. It does *not* perform
//!   continuum subtraction, star removal, SCNR/green-cast suppression, or any
//!   non-linear blend (e.g. PixInsight's `Lighten`/`Screen`). Those are
//!   separate, downstream steps; this primitive deliberately stays a pure
//!   linear mixer so it is exact and testable.
//! - The weight tables returned by [`sho_palette`]/[`hoo_palette`] are the
//!   *canonical* 1.0 mappings (each line goes to its channel at unit gain).
//!   Real artistic palettes routinely rebalance these (e.g. a reduced Hα-into-R
//!   contribution to tame a magenta cast); those are defensible per-image
//!   choices, not defaults this module bakes in. Pass custom weights to
//!   [`combine_channels`] when you want them.
//! - No tone mapping, white balance, or clipping is applied. Negative results
//!   (possible if a weight is negative) are preserved as-is in the linear `F32`
//!   master; clamping is the display layer's job.
