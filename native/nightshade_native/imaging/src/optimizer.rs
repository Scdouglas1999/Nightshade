//! Marginal-SNR integration optimizer (Pillar 2): *prove the cull before you
//! pay for it*.
//!
//! [`crate::frame_weighting`] tells you how much each sub should *weigh*; this
//! module answers the next, more actionable question: **how many of the
//! weight-ranked subs are actually worth integrating?** Past some point each
//! additional, lower-weight sub adds more of its own noise than signal and the
//! stacked SNR stops climbing — and a genuinely bad sub (cloud, satellite-lit
//! background, lost guiding) makes it *fall*. The honest answer to "keep all of
//! them" is usually "no": a smaller, cleaner subset can beat the full stack.
//!
//! The whole module is **pure and cheap**. It takes the per-frame quality
//! descriptors and weights you already computed and *predicts* the integrated
//! SNR of every weight-ordered prefix analytically. It performs **no
//! re-integration** — no pixels are touched. The output is a recommendation the
//! caller may accept or ignore (exactly the project's never-silently-drop
//! idiom): which subs to keep, the predicted SNR change versus keeping
//! everything, and a human-readable reason.
//!
//! ## The noise model (state the assumption plainly)
//!
//! We model the stack as a **background-limited, independent-noise weighted
//! mean** — the standard regime for deep-sky integration where each sub's noise
//! is dominated by sky-background shot noise plus read noise and is independent
//! frame-to-frame. Under that model, for a weighted mean with per-sub weights
//! `wᵢ`, signal `sᵢ`, and per-sub noise variance `vᵢ`:
//!
//! ```text
//!                Σ wᵢ·sᵢ
//!   SNR(set) = ─────────────────
//!              √( Σ wᵢ²·vᵢ )
//! ```
//!
//! This is the textbook error-propagation result for a linear combination of
//! independent Gaussian estimates (the numerator is the combined signal; the
//! denominator is the combined noise, with each sub's variance scaled by the
//! *square* of its weight because variance propagates through a weight as `w²`).
//! We recover each sub's signal and noise from its [`FrameQuality`]:
//! `signalᵢ = snrᵢ · noiseᵢ` (so `snrᵢ = signalᵢ / noiseᵢ` by construction) and
//! `vᵢ = noiseᵢ²`. With all weights and noises equal this collapses to the
//! familiar `SNR(n) = √n · SNR₁` — the `√n` improvement law — which is exactly
//! what test 1 pins down.
//!
//! ## What "recommend a subset" means
//!
//! 1. Rank subs by weight, best first (stable, so ties keep input order).
//! 2. Walk the prefixes `n = 1..=N` and predict `SNR(n)` with the formula above.
//! 3. Find two landmarks on that curve:
//!    - `n_maxsnr` — the prefix with the highest predicted SNR (keep *exactly*
//!      this many for the mathematically best stack; anything past it is a sub
//!      whose noise outweighs its signal).
//!    - `n_knee` — the first prefix where the *marginal* SNR gain
//!      `(SNR(n) − SNR(n−1)) / SNR(n)` drops below a small epsilon: the point of
//!      diminishing returns, where you are spending integration time for almost
//!      no SNR. This is the classic "elbow"/knee of a diminishing-returns curve.
//! 4. Interpolate between them by `aggressiveness ∈ [0, 1]` (0 = stop at the
//!    knee, conservative; 1 = chase the max-SNR point, maximally aggressive) and
//!    clamp into `[min_keep, N]`.
//! 5. Apply the **never-harm floor**. The knee is a *wall-clock* landmark — it
//!    answers "is it worth more capture time to keep shooting?", where each extra
//!    sub costs real minutes. But this module's question is "which of the frames
//!    *already on disk* should I integrate?", and for a captured sub the marginal
//!    cost is zero: there is never a reason to drop a net-positive frame. So the
//!    knee must never pull `keep_n` below the SNR-monotone region. We floor
//!    `keep_n` at the smallest prefix whose predicted SNR already meets the
//!    full-stack SNR, which guarantees the recommended subset is never one the
//!    model itself predicts is *worse* than keeping everything (a smaller cleaner
//!    subset can still win, but only by *recovering* SNR from net-negative subs).
//!
//! ## Honest limits (per the design doc's "made honest, not functional" bar)
//!
//! - The **noise model** is the explicit assumption above. It is the right
//!   first-order model for background-limited deep-sky subs and matches the
//!   inverse-variance spirit of [`crate::frame_weighting`]'s default weighting,
//!   but it does *not* model object (source) shot noise, spatially varying
//!   coverage, or rejection — those are integration-time effects this cheap
//!   predictor deliberately does not simulate. It predicts the *trend* (does
//!   adding sub k help or hurt?), which is what the cull decision needs; it is
//!   not a substitute for measuring the real master.
//! - The knee epsilon and the default `aggressiveness` (0.7) are **defensible
//!   defaults, not corpus-tuned**. They are exposed as knobs precisely so they
//!   can be revisited against real sub sets. The curve itself is deterministic
//!   and unit-tested on synthetic descriptors here.
