//! The per-step-boundary intermediate cache.
//!
//! A cache entry holds the image as it stands after a prefix of the recipe. The
//! key is that prefix's canonical form, so editing step `N` changes the key of
//! every boundary from `N` onward and leaves boundaries below `N` reachable —
//! invalidation falls out of the key rather than being tracked separately.
//!
//! Disabled steps are absent from the key: toggling a step off returns to the
//! key the stack had before the step existed, so a disable/enable cycle costs no
//! re-render below the toggle.
//!
//! The key is the canonical prefix string itself, not a digest of it. A digest
//! collision would serve one recipe's pixels for another's, and the strings are
//! kilobytes at most.
//!
//! The key also carries [`OpContext::identity`], so attaching a photometric
//! catalogue or a different plate solve invalidates the boundaries that
//! depended on it. A catalogue contributes its contents through
//! [`PhotometryCatalog::identity`](super::model::PhotometryCatalog::identity),
//! not merely its presence: a handle that gains stars keys differently, so a
//! caller that reloads catalogue data needs no [`RenderCache::clear`] to keep
//! one star list's colours out of another's render.
