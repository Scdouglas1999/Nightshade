//! Colour saturation on stretched data, with the boost attenuated where it
//! would do harm.
//!
//! Saturation moves each channel away from the pixel's own luminance:
//!
//! ```text
//! out_c = v_c + amount · protect(L) · (v_c − L)
//! L     = 0.2126·R + 0.7152·G + 0.0722·B
//! ```
//!
//! `amount = 0` leaves every sample exactly where it was, `amount > 0` pushes
//! the channels apart, and `amount = −1` collapses them onto `L` — a
//! desaturation to grey. Writing the operation as a *departure* from the input
//! rather than as `L + gain·(v_c − L)` is what makes the zero case exact.
//!
//! # Luminance protection
//!
//! ```text
//! protect(L) = 1 − protection · (1 − 4·L·(1 − L))
//! ```
//!
//! is `1` at mid-tone and falls to `1 − protection` at both ends of the display
//! range. Near white the channels are converging on the clip point and pushing
//! them apart only clips one of them; near black what separates the channels is
//! chroma noise, and a saturation boost there amplifies exactly that. `L` is
//! clamped into `[0, 1]` before the factor is evaluated, so a sample outside the
//! display range gets the end-of-range protection rather than a factor that
//! turns negative.
//!
//! # Domain
//!
//! Input and output are the display domain `[0, 1]` that `stretch@1` emits.
//! Output is clamped there, so `amount = 0` is an exact clone of any frame whose
//! samples already lie inside it.
//!
//! # Channels
//!
//! Three channels only: the luminance weights are the Rec. 709 primaries, and a
//! mono master has no channel to move away from its own luminance.
//!
//! Every parameter is in value units, so none of them scales with the preview
//! level.
