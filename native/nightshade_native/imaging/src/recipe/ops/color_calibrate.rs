//! Colour calibration on linear data: a `B − V` colour-versus-flux regression
//! against the shipped photometry, solved from the frame's own astrometry.
//!
//! # What this operation is
//!
//! Aperture photometry measures every matched star's background-subtracted flux
//! in each channel. The catalogue supplies each star's Johnson `B − V`. For each
//! channel the pair `(B − V, log₁₀ flux)` is fitted robustly, and the flux a
//! reference-colour star would read is read off the fitted line; the reciprocal
//! of that flux, normalised so green is exactly `1`, is the channel scale.
//! [`crate::color_calibration::solve_color_calibration`] is the fit.
//!
//! Using the whole star population rather than one white star is what makes the
//! answer robust: a single star may be a blend, mildly saturated, or sitting on
//! a gradient, and the fit tolerates a large fraction of such blunders.
//!
//! # What this operation is not
//!
//! It is not spectrophotometric calibration. The shipped photometry is Johnson
//! `B` and `V` only (HYG `ci`, APASS DR9), there is no Gaia `BP`/`RP` in the
//! tree and no filter-transmission or sensor-QE database, so the colour term is
//! a single `B − V` slope per channel and nothing about the instrument's
//! spectral response is modelled. Neither the code nor the interface claims
//! otherwise.
//!
//! # Channels
//!
//! Three channels only. A one-channel master has no channel balance to solve —
//! the underlying normalisation would return a unit scale and the "calibrated"
//! image would be byte-identical to its input — so a mono master is
//! [`OpError::UnsupportedChannels`] here and is combined to RGB first.
//!
//! # Measuring once, replaying everywhere
//!
//! A step with no `channelScale` measures a balance from the image it is handed.
//! A step that carries one is in *pinned mode*: it applies exactly those scales
//! and reads neither the catalogue nor the astrometry. [`solve`] measures,
//! [`ColorSolve::to_params`] writes the answer into the step, and every later
//! render — full resolution or preview — replays the same numbers. That is what
//! a preview needs: a downsampled level carries fewer measurable stars than the
//! fit requires, so a step that re-measured at every level would fail on the
//! preview of a master it calibrates perfectly well at full resolution.
//!
//! The two modes are the same arithmetic over the same scales, so pinning the
//! scales a render reported reproduces that render's pixels bit for bit. Both
//! are `color_calibrate@1`: an absent `channelScale` renders exactly what it
//! always did, so every recipe already on disk replays unchanged.
//!
//! Every application reports what it applied — the scales, and for a solve the
//! reference colour, the matched-star count and the fit residual — as the step's
//! [`OpApplied::measurement`]. That read-back is how a draft learns the scales
//! to pin without solving the field a second time.
//!
//! # Astrometry
//!
//! The cross-match reads the astrometry out of the image's own header, which
//! `crop@1` and the preview pyramid keep truthful, so the catalogue lands in the
//! pixel frame the photometry was measured in. A master with no plate solve
//! cannot be cross-matched at all and reports [`OpError::Failed`].
//!
//! # Preview scale
//!
//! `matchRadiusPx` is in pixels at full resolution and is multiplied by
//! [`OpContext::scale`]. The aperture and annulus radii are derived from each
//! star's own measured HFR, which is already in render-level pixels, so they
//! need no scaling. `channelScale`, `whiteRefBv`, `magLimit` and `minStars` are
//! in value units.
