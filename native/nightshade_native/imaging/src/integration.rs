//! Advanced weighted **batch** image integration with pixel rejection.
//!
//! This is the post-session (offline, archival-quality) counterpart to the
//! online, single-pass combiner baked into [`crate::stacking::LiveStacker`].
//! Where the live stacker must commit to each sub the moment it arrives — and
//! therefore can only do an *online* sigma clip against a running mean — this
//! module sees the **entire aligned population at once** and can run rejection
//! algorithms that need the full per-pixel distribution: Winsorized sigma
//! clipping, linear-fit clipping, percentile clipping, classic sigma clipping,
//! and min/max clipping. That batch view is what makes the result
//! order-independent and lets the strongest rejectors (linear-fit, Winsorized)
//! work at all.
//!
//! ## What this module assumes about its input
//!
//! Integration is the *last* stage of the post-session pipeline. By the time a
//! frame reaches here it must already be:
//!
//! 1. **Aligned** onto the common reference grid (see
//!    [`crate::registration::register_frame`]) — every input frame has the same
//!    `width × height × channels`.
//! 2. **Normalized** onto the reference's photometric scale (see
//!    [`crate::normalization::apply_normalization`]) — otherwise sigma rejection
//!    would clip real signal away as if it were an outlier.
//! 3. **Weighted** with a scalar quality weight (see
//!    [`crate::frame_weighting::weight_frames`]) — better subs pull the master
//!    toward themselves.
//!
//! This module does **none** of those steps; it consumes their output. Each
//! input frame is an `f64` buffer (in whatever ADU domain the normalizer left
//! it in) plus a scalar weight and an optional per-pixel
//! [`crate::normalization::CoverageMask`] describing which pixels actually had
//! valid source support after the warp (edges that only some frames cover).
//!
//! ## Outputs
//!
//! [`integrate_frames`] returns:
//!
//! - the integrated **master** ([`ImageData`], `F32` linear by default, the
//!   archival format, or `U16` when a caller wants the legacy 16-bit path);
//! - a per-pixel **rejection-count map** (how many samples were rejected at
//!   each output pixel — this is where satellite trails, planes, and cosmic
//!   rays light up);
//! - a per-pixel **effective-weight map** (the sum of the weights that actually
//!   contributed to each output pixel — a coverage/SNR diagnostic);
//! - aggregate [`IntegrationStats`].
//!
//! All maps and the master are computed **per channel** so OSC (3-channel)
//! masters reject and weight each channel independently — a hot red pixel must
//! not drag the green and blue channels with it.
//!
//! ## Honest limits (per the design doc's "made honest, not functional" bar)
//!
//! The *algorithms* here are deterministic, order-independent, and unit-tested
//! against synthetic data with injected outliers. The default sigma thresholds
//! (`low`/`high`) are defensible PixInsight-spirit defaults but are exposed as
//! knobs precisely because their sweet spot depends on sub count and data; the
//! caller (and ultimately the UI) picks the rejector and thresholds. Linear-fit
//! clipping here is the standard "fit a line to the *sorted* samples, reject by
//! residual" formulation; like every batch rejector it degrades gracefully to
//! the plain weighted mean when there are too few samples to estimate scatter.
