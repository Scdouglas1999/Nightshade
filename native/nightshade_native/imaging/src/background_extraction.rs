//! Background / gradient extraction — a DBE/ABE analogue (Pillar 3c).
//!
//! Wide-field deep-sky frames almost never have a flat sky. Light pollution,
//! moonlight, amp glow, vignetting residual after flat-fielding, and gradient
//! from an uneven sky all leave a smooth, **low-spatial-frequency** ramp across
//! the frame. That ramp is not signal — it is an additive pedestal that varies
//! slowly with position — and if it is left in place it wrecks the stretch
//! (one corner clips to black while the other blows out) and biases every
//! downstream colour/contrast operation.
//!
//! PixInsight solves this with two tools: **Automatic Background Extractor**
//! (ABE) fits a low-order polynomial to automatically-chosen background samples,
//! and **DynamicBackgroundExtraction** (DBE) does the same with a user-placed
//! sample grid and a spline/poly model. Both share one core idea, which is what
//! this module implements:
//!
//! 1. Lay a regular **grid of small sample boxes** over each channel.
//! 2. In each box take a **robust low estimate** of the level (a median, which
//!    ignores the bright pixels of any star that happens to sit in the box).
//! 3. **Reject boxes that are contaminated** by stars or bright structure — a
//!    box whose robust level sits far above the field's low-percentile baseline,
//!    or that overlaps a detected star, is dropped so the model is never pulled
//!    up toward an object.
//! 4. **Iteratively sigma-clip** the surviving samples (`sigma_low`/`sigma_high`)
//!    so that the few remaining contaminated or faint-nebulosity samples do not
//!    bias the fit.
//! 5. Fit a **2-D polynomial** of the requested degree to the survivors by least
//!    squares (normal equations), with `x`/`y` normalised to `[-1, 1]` for
//!    conditioning, and store the coefficients.
//!
//! Subtracting the evaluated model flattens the frame. When `preserve_mean` is
//! set the model's own mean level is added back so the operation only removes
//! the *gradient* and not the overall sky pedestal — exactly DBE/ABE's
//! "Subtraction, normalise to target background" behaviour, which keeps faint
//! extended signal (nebulosity) intact instead of clipping it to black.
//!
//! ## Why star-masked + robust + clipped (and not a plain surface fit)
//!
//! The whole difficulty is that the thing we want to model (the background) is
//! *defined by the absence* of the thing that dominates the pixel values
//! (stars and nebulosity). A naive least-squares plane through every pixel
//! would chase the stars. Three independent defences make the estimate honest:
//! the per-box **median** is immune to a star covering a minority of the box;
//! the **baseline + star-overlap rejection** throws away whole boxes that are
//! object-dominated; and the **sigma clip** removes the residual high-side
//! samples (faint nebulosity, box edges catching a star wing). This is the same
//! layered-robustness strategy the rest of the crate uses for noise
//! ([`crate::frame_weighting`]) and pixel rejection ([`crate::integration`]).
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! The defaults (`grid = 24`, `poly_degree = 4`, `sample_box = 15`,
//! `sigma_low = 3.0`, `sigma_high = 2.0`) are defensible DBE/ABE-spirit values,
//! **not** numbers tuned against a corpus of real frames — they are exposed as
//! knobs precisely so they can be revisited with data. The model is a global
//! polynomial, which captures smooth low-order gradients and vignetting
//! residual well but **cannot** represent sharp, localised glow (a bright amp
//! glow corner, a satellite-flare halo); those need the spline/DBE path and are
//! out of scope here. `poly_degree` is capped at 6: beyond that the normal
//! equations become ill-conditioned even after `[-1,1]` normalisation and the
//! model starts fitting noise, so we reject the request rather than return a
//! garbage surface. The least-squares solve is a straightforward Gauss-Jordan
//! on the normal-equation matrix — fine for the ≤28-term systems a degree-≤6 2-D
//! polynomial produces, and deterministic so the tests are reproducible.
