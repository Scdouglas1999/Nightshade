//! Difference imaging (Pillar B — "First Light"): subtract the atlas's deep
//! co-added template from a fresh plate-solved frame and surface what changed.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The sky atlas ([`crate::sky_atlas`]) gives every patch of sky a deep, additive
//! template — the running weighted mean of every night ever folded into a tile.
//! That template is the strongest reference an amateur rig can have for "what does
//! this field normally look like". Difference imaging exploits it: reproject
//! tonight's frame onto the exact tile grid the template lives on, scale it
//! photometrically to the template, subtract, and whatever is *left* in the
//! residual is something that changed — a nova, a supernova, an outburst, an
//! asteroid streak, or (most often) a star that simply was not deep enough in the
//! template yet. That last class is the false-positive the catalog cross-match in
//! the Dart layer rejects; this module's job is to find every real residual source
//! honestly and hand it up with enough shape/flux metadata to classify it.
//!
//! # The pipeline (one tile)
//!
//! 1. **Reproject** the new frame onto the tile's canonical TAN grid
//!    ([`crate::sky_atlas::tile_wcs`]) using the frame's full CD + SIP astrometry
//!    ([`crate::wcs_sip::SipWcs`]) and the shared resampler
//!    ([`crate::registration::sample_interleaved`]) — exactly the reprojection the
//!    fold path uses, so the residual is registered to sub-pixel accuracy.
//! 2. **Photometrically match** the reprojected frame to the template with a robust
//!    Theil–Sen line fit (`template ≈ scale·frame + offset`) over the overlap: the
//!    median of pairwise slopes has a ~29% breakdown point, so the very transients
//!    we are hunting cannot bias the scale even on a sparse field with few shared
//!    stars (where an iterated-OLS clip would be dragged by a high-leverage point).
//! 3. **Subtract** to a signed `F32` residual `(matched_frame − template)`, only
//!    where both the reprojected frame and the template have coverage (a thin
//!    template region is a quality gate, not a fabricated zero).
//! 4. **Extract sources** on the `+residual` (brightenings / new sources) and the
//!    `−residual` (the negative lobe of a subtraction dipole — a registration or
//!    PSF-mismatch artefact, flagged so the Dart layer can down-weight it). Source
//!    extraction is a sigma-clipped-background, 8-connected-maxima detector with
//!    HFR/FWHM/eccentricity measurement, the same estimator family as
//!    [`crate::stats::detect_stars`] but operating on the signed residual plane
//!    (which `detect_stars` cannot, as it decodes `U16`).
//! 5. **Classify** each candidate ([`TransientKind`]) from its residual sign, the
//!    presence of a paired opposite-sign lobe (dipole), and its elongation
//!    (a streak), and convert its tile pixel to `(ra, dec)` through the tile WCS.
//!
//! The catalog / photometric / moving-object cross-match that turns a residual
//! source into a *named* known object (or a flagged unknown) happens Dart-side in
//! `FirstLightService.scanFrame`; this module deliberately stops at the geometry +
//! photometry so the native boundary stays catalog-free.
