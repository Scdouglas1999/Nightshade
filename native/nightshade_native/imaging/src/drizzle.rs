//! Drizzle (variable-pixel linear reconstruction) and Bayer-drizzle integration.
//!
//! This module implements the Fruchter–Hook *drizzle* algorithm — "variable-pixel
//! linear reconstruction" — and its colour-filter-array (CFA / Bayer) variant for
//! one-shot-colour (OSC) cameras. Drizzle is the standard technique for recovering
//! resolution from a stack of **dithered, under-sampled** sub-frames: see
//! Fruchter & Hook, *PASP* 114, 144 (2002), the method developed for the
//! Hubble Deep Field.
//!
//! ## What drizzle does (and why it beats a plain warp-and-average)
//!
//! A classical resampling warp (see [`crate::registration::register_frame`]) maps
//! each *output* pixel back to a fractional *input* location and interpolates.
//! That convolves the data with the interpolation kernel, softening the PSF and
//! correlating the noise — and for an under-sampled signal (a star whose PSF is
//! ~1 pixel FWHM) it cannot reconstruct detail finer than the input grid.
//!
//! Drizzle instead works **forward**: it treats each input pixel as a small
//! "drop" of flux and *paints* (drizzles) that drop onto a finer output grid,
//! shrunk by the linear factor `pixfrac` and weighted by the geometric overlap
//! area between the drop and each output cell. Because many frames are dithered
//! by sub-pixel offsets, different frames deposit their drops at different
//! sub-pixel phases on the output grid; the accumulated, overlap-weighted average
//! recovers spatial frequencies above the input Nyquist that no single frame
//! sampled. The output is sharper and the noise is *less* correlated than an
//! interpolated warp.
//!
//! ## The overlap-area kernel (the heart of the algorithm)
//!
//! Output grid dimensions are `ceil(ref_w · scale) × ceil(ref_h · scale)`. For an
//! input pixel whose **centre** maps (via the frame's [`TransformModel`], then a
//! multiply by `scale`) to output coordinate `(ox, oy)`, the drop is a square of
//! side `pixfrac · scale` centred at `(ox, oy)` — i.e. an input pixel, which is a
//! unit square in input space, shrinks to side `pixfrac` in input units and then
//! magnifies by `scale` into output units. (We assume the transform is locally a
//! similarity, the regime drizzle is used in; the drop is axis-aligned in output
//! space, which is the universal "square-kernel" drizzle approximation and the
//! one PixInsight / DrizzlePac use for the square kernel.)
//!
//! For each output cell `[cx, cx+1] × [cy, cy+1]` the deposited weight is the
//! **area of intersection** of that unit cell with the drop rectangle:
//!
//! ```text
//!     drop  = [ox − d, ox + d] × [oy − d, oy + d],   d = pixfrac · scale / 2
//!     overlap(cell) = max(0, min(ox+d, cx+1) − max(ox−d, cx))
//!                   · max(0, min(oy+d, cy+1) − max(oy−d, cy))
//! ```
//!
//! That product of clamped 1-D overlaps is the classic separable box∩box area.
//! Per output cell we accumulate
//!
//! ```text
//!     flux[cell]   += value · frame_weight · overlap
//!     weight[cell] += frame_weight · overlap
//! ```
//!
//! and after every frame the reconstructed master is `flux / weight` where
//! `weight > 0`, else 0 (an uncovered cell). This is exactly the Fruchter–Hook
//! accumulation; it is *flux-conserving* in the sense that, summed over the
//! output cells a drop touches, the deposited weight equals `frame_weight ·
//! (pixfrac·scale)²`, and the value is the overlap-weighted mean of the inputs
//! that landed there.
//!
//! The [`DrizzleKernel::Gaussian`] and [`DrizzleKernel::Point`] variants replace
//! the box overlap with, respectively, a Gaussian footprint integrated over the
//! cell (smoother, trades resolution for a softer noise floor) and a
//! nearest-cell delta (`pixfrac → 0` limit: deposit the whole drop into the one
//! cell containing the centre — the sharpest, noisiest choice). `Square` is the
//! default and the one with rigorous flux-conservation guarantees.
//!
//! ## Bayer (CFA) drizzle
//!
//! [`bayer_drizzle_integrate`] drizzles a raw, **un-debayered** CFA mosaic. Each
//! mosaic pixel carries exactly one colour (determined by its position in the
//! Bayer pattern), so it is deposited **only into its own colour plane** of the
//! RGB output — there is *no* debayer interpolation. Dithering across frames
//! fills in the colour planes that a single CFA frame leaves sparse, so the RGB
//! master is reconstructed at higher resolution directly from the raw sub-pixel
//! samples. This is "Bayer drizzle" / "CFA drizzle" as popularised by
//! DeepSkyStacker and PixInsight's `DrizzleIntegration` in CFA mode, and it
//! avoids the chroma smearing a demosaic-then-drizzle pipeline introduces.
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//!
//! - The `Square` drop is axis-aligned in output space; under a transform with
//!   significant **rotation** the true drop is a rotated square and the
//!   axis-aligned box is an approximation. For the dither-and-similarity regime
//!   drizzle targets (small rotations) this is the standard, well-justified
//!   approximation; large field rotation between subs would want a full polygon
//!   clip, which this module does not implement.
//! - `pixfrac` and the Gaussian footprint width are exposed knobs with defensible
//!   defaults (`pixfrac = 0.9`, the DrizzlePac default; Gaussian σ tied to the
//!   drop half-width), **not** corpus-tuned constants.
//! - Accumulation is into a single shared flux/weight buffer pair (memory =
//!   `O(output pixels)`, independent of frame count), matching the
//!   "memory-reasonable" requirement.
