//! Star-size reduction preview (Algo track).
//!
//! Bright stars dominate a deep-sky image visually: once nebulosity and faint
//! structure are stretched up, oversized stellar cores and their bloated halos
//! compete with the subject for attention. "Star reduction" is the standard
//! post-processing answer — PixInsight's *MorphologicalTransformation* (an
//! erosion confined to a star mask) and Russell Croman's *StarXTerminator* /
//! the classic *screen-and-residual* recipe are the two families practitioners
//! reach for. This module implements a **non-destructive, mask-confined**
//! preview of both: only pixels that fall inside a detected-star mask are
//! touched, and every pixel **outside** the mask is byte-identical to the
//! input. That invariant is what makes this safe to run as a live "preview"
//! over a calibrated linear or stretched frame without corrupting the
//! background, faint galaxies, or nebulosity the user actually came for.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! 1. **Detect stars** with the crate's [`crate::detect_stars`] (the same
//!    detector the autofocus / grading paths use), giving a list of
//!    sub-pixel centres each with a measured HFR.
//! 2. **Build a soft star mask.** Each star contributes a feathered disk: a
//!    flat core out to a radius proportional to its HFR, then a smooth cosine
//!    feather out to `core + dilate + feather`. Disks are combined with a
//!    `max` (union) so overlapping stars merge cleanly. The result is a
//!    per-pixel weight in `[0, 1]`: `1` deep inside a star, `0` on clean
//!    background, fractional in the feather ring. This is the direct analogue
//!    of a *star mask* in PixInsight, dilated by `mask_dilate` so the halo
//!    just outside the photometric core is also reduced.
//! 3. **Compute a reduced plane** under one of two methods:
//!    * [`StarReduceMethod::MorphologicalErosion`] — a grayscale **erosion**
//!      (local minimum over a small structuring disk). Eroding a bright blob
//!      shrinks it from the edges inward, which is exactly the geometric
//!      operation that makes a star smaller. This is the operation
//!      PixInsight's *MorphologicalTransformation → Erosion* performs inside a
//!      star mask.
//!    * [`StarReduceMethod::ScreenedResidual`] — estimate a **star-free
//!      background** under each star with a local minimum/median filter,
//!      compute `residual = image − background` (the star's own light above
//!      the local floor), scale that residual *down* by `strength`, and
//!      recombine `background + residual·(1 − strength)`. Shrinking a star's
//!      excess-over-background lowers its peak and pulls its wings toward the
//!      floor, which both dims and tightens it. This is the "screen the stars,
//!      keep the residual, attenuate it" recipe.
//! 4. **Composite** the reduced plane back over the input using the mask weight
//!    *attenuated by `strength`*: `out = input·(1 − w·s) + reduced·(w·s)`. A
//!    pixel with mask weight `0` (clean background) keeps its **exact input
//!    bytes** — no float round-trip, no off-by-one — so the background is
//!    provably untouched. `strength = 0` is the identity transform.
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//!
//! The geometric constants here — the core-radius multiple of HFR
//! ([`HFR_CORE_MULTIPLE`]), the feather width ([`DEFAULT_FEATHER_PX`]), the
//! erosion structuring radius ([`EROSION_RADIUS_PX`]), and the background
//! estimator window — are **defensible defaults in the spirit of the standard
//! tools, not values tuned against a corpus** of real images. They are sized
//! relative to the measured per-star HFR so they adapt to focal length /
//! seeing, but a power user would still want a UI knob for each. The detection
//! pass uses [`StarDetectionConfig::default`] with the star-mask-friendly
//! relaxations documented in [`reduce_stars`]; it is deliberately
//! conservative (it reduces what it is confident is a star and leaves
//! ambiguous compact structure alone). Detection runs on a per-pixel **max
//! across channels** so a star bright in only one channel (a blue or Hα-bright
//! star faint in red) still enters the mask — detecting on a single channel
//! could drop it and leave it at full size everywhere. The *reduction* methods
//! operate per channel independently, which is correct for mono and acceptable
//! for RGB previews but is *not* a colour-preserving star reduction — a
//! production path would reduce on luminance and re-apply the ratio to
//! chrominance. That is out of scope for this preview and noted here rather than
//! silently assumed.
