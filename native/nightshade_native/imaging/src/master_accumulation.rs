//! Multi-night accumulating master frame.
//!
//! This is the headline feature of the post-session pipeline: a **serializable
//! running master** you can keep adding subs to across many nights, without
//! ever re-reading the subs already folded in. Each clear night you point it at
//! that night's new (aligned, normalized, weighted) subs, call
//! [`IntegratedMaster::add_frames`], and the master grows; the artifact
//! [`IntegratedMaster::finalize`] produces always reflects the *entire* history.
//!
//! ## Why a weighted mean is exactly accumulable
//!
//! The estimator the master uses is a per-pixel **weighted mean**. The crucial
//! property is that a weighted mean decomposes into two running sums that are
//! both additive across disjoint batches:
//!
//! ```text
//!     master(p) = Σ wᵢ·xᵢ(p) / Σ wᵢ          (sum over every sub i ever folded)
//! ```
//!
//! Storing `sum_wx = Σ wᵢ·xᵢ` and `sum_w = Σ wᵢ` per pixel lets us add a new
//! batch by simply adding its contributions to the running sums and dividing at
//! the very end. Splitting the subs into any number of batches and folding them
//! one batch at a time yields a result **bit-for-bit identical** (to f64
//! rounding) to integrating all of them at once. We additionally carry
//! `sum_wx2 = Σ wᵢ·xᵢ²` so a running variance / per-pixel SNR is available for
//! diagnostics and for the online rejection clip below. This online-vs-batch
//! parity is the property the unit tests pin.
//!
//! ## What this module assumes about its input (same contract as `integration`)
//!
//! [`add_frames`](IntegratedMaster::add_frames) consumes frames that are already
//!
//! 1. **Aligned** onto the frozen geometric reference grid
//!    ([`crate::registration::register_frame`]) — every frame must match the
//!    master's `width × height × channels`.
//! 2. **Normalized** onto the *frozen* photometric reference stored in the
//!    master at creation (see [`NormalizationReference`]). Freezing the
//!    normalization reference at creation is what makes cross-night
//!    accumulation valid: every later night is brought onto the same
//!    background-and-scale footing as the first night, so a pixel's value means
//!    the same thing regardless of which night it came from.
//! 3. **Weighted** with a scalar quality weight
//!    ([`crate::frame_weighting::weight_frames`]).
//!
//! This module performs none of those steps; it folds their output into the
//! running state. It mirrors the [`crate::integration::IntegrationFrame`]
//! contract exactly so the same prepared buffers feed either the one-shot batch
//! integrator or the accumulating master.
//!
//! ## The accumulation/rejection tradeoff
//!
//! Full batch rejection (Winsorized-σ, linear-fit-clip, …) needs the *entire*
//! per-pixel sample column at once. An accumulating master, by construction,
//! does **not** keep old subs around, so it cannot re-run a full batch clip when
//! a new night arrives. Instead it offers an **online robust clip**: each new
//! sub's pixel is tested against the *current running mean ± k·running σ* before
//! it is folded in (the same spirit as the live stacker's online clip, but
//! persisted in the master state). This is not identical to re-integrating every
//! night's full population from scratch — it is the standard, honest
//! accumulation tradeoff. The master records its
//! [`AccumulationMode`] so a UI can offer a "full re-integrate from archived
//! subs" path (via [`crate::integration::integrate_frames`]) whenever the
//! original subs are still on disk.
//!
//! With [`AccumulationMode::RunningWeightedMean`] and `clip == None` (no online
//! rejection), accumulation is provably exact vs. a single batch weighted mean —
//! that is the parity the tests assert.
