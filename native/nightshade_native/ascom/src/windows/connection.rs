// ============================================================================
// AscomConnectionBackend trait — mockall seam for unit-testing per-device
// wrappers without a live Windows COM driver.
// ============================================================================

// Why: per-device modules (camera.rs, switch.rs, cover_calibrator.rs, …) call
// into `AscomDeviceConnection` for every COM operation. To unit-test those
// modules we need a fake implementation. This trait names the operations
// callers actually use; mockall generates a `MockAscomConnectionBackend`
// from it on demand.
//
// Scope (MVP): only the two methods sibling modules call directly today —
// `get_dispid` (DISPID lookup) and `call_method` (parameterless dispatch).
// Adding the remaining typed helpers is a follow-on task tracked under
// we deliberately do NOT widen the trait surface here so
// that the per-device modules can keep using `&AscomDeviceConnection`
// unchanged until the next pass.
//
// Why `cfg_attr(any(test, feature = "mock"), …)` instead of just
// `cfg_attr(test, …)`: integration tests live in `tests/` and compile as a
// separate crate that does NOT see this crate's `cfg(test)` build, so the
// generated `MockAscomConnectionBackend` would be invisible to them. The
// `mock` cargo feature is enabled by the test crate via dev-dependencies
// in `Cargo.toml`, which surfaces the mock to integration tests without
// pulling mockall into production builds.

// `AscomCamera`) is created on, and from then on only ever touched from, the
// owning apartment thread — the process-wide STA worker
// (`ascom_wrapper::sta_worker`) for the camera/mount/filter-wheel classes, or a
// per-device STA worker for the others. Every COM call is dispatched onto that
// thread via a channel, and `Drop` is a no-op, so the wrapper struct is safe to
// move/share across other threads (only its handle moves; the IDispatch is
// released on the apartment thread when the on-thread pump drops it).
