//! Read-back verification policy for ASCOM connects.
//!
//! Setting `Connected = true` on an ASCOM driver and getting no COM exception
//! is **not** evidence that a device is there. ASCOM registers *drivers*, not
//! *hardware*, so a driver for a device the operator does not own is a normal
//! entry in every device list. Measured on a real rig on 2026-08-09:
//! `ASCOM.ASIMount.Telescope`, with no ASI mount in the building, accepted
//! `Connected = true` in 54 ms without complaint and then reported
//! `Connected = False`, `Slewing = True`, `SiderealTime = -1` and RA/Dec/Alt/Az
//! all zero — for the full 20 s the probe watched, and after a clean
//! disconnect too. An app that believes the write announces a connected mount
//! and serves `slewing: true` for ever, which hangs any wait-for-slew: slew &
//! centre, meridian flip, and the sequencer's own move steps all block until
//! morning.
//!
//! The policy therefore is: write, then poll the property back until the
//! driver agrees or the budget runs out.
//!
//! This module is deliberately platform-independent and free of COM types so
//! the timing and message policy can be tested on any host. The COM plumbing
//! that feeds it lives in `windows::connection`.

use std::time::Duration;

/// How long to wait for a driver to actually report `Connected = true` after
/// accepting the request.
///
/// **The two ways to be wrong here are not equally costly.** Believing a
/// phantom costs the entire night, silently — that is the bug this module
/// exists to stop. But rejecting a slow-but-genuine device is a *new* failure
/// mode introduced by the check, and for an unattended run it also costs the
/// night. So the budget is set by how long real hardware may reasonably take,
/// not by how long an operator is willing to watch a spinner.
///
/// Waiting long is close to free: the loop returns the instant the driver says
/// `true`, so a healthy device pays only its own latency (every device on the
/// reference rig read back `true` on the first poll). The budget is only ever
/// spent in full on a device that is genuinely not coming up, where the
/// alternative outcome is an all-night hang.
///
/// **There is a hard ceiling, and it is not operator patience — it is the
/// transport.** Every ASCOM device in the bridge is driven through a worker
/// thread whose `connect` reply is awaited under `Timeouts::connection()`
/// (`nightshade_bridge::timeout_ops`), currently 30 s. If `connect()` takes
/// longer than that, the caller has already given up: the oneshot receiver is
/// dropped, the operator is shown `"<device> connect timed out after 30s"`,
/// and the message this module works so hard to compose is thrown away
/// unread. Measured on the reference rig 2026-08-09 with a 30 s budget, the
/// phantom `ASCOM.ASIMount.Telescope` was rejected at **30.064 s** — past the
/// transport's deadline on every single attempt, so the diagnostic never once
/// reached a user.
///
/// So the budget must leave room for the whole of `connect()`: the
/// `Connected = true` write, the polling, and the cleanup write on the way
/// out. 20 s leaves ~10 s of that headroom while still standing 60x above the
/// slowest real device measured (315 ms, ASI178MM through the production
/// `connect()`), and `bridge::timeout_ops` carries a test that fails if either
/// side of this relationship drifts.

/// the operator-facing message describing what actually happened — the caller
/// is responsible for putting the driver back down before surfacing it.
///
/// `elapsed` reports time since the connect request; `sleep` waits between
/// polls. Both are injected so the policy can be tested without real time.
///
/// A read that *throws* is treated the same as a read that returns `false` —
/// both mean "the driver has not confirmed" — but the most recent exception is
/// carried into the message, because "still reports Connected = false" and
