//! What Nightshade is allowed to write when it commands an ASCOM cooler.
//!
//! Not gated behind `cfg(windows)`: this is pure policy over two booleans and
//! an `Option`, so it stays testable on the Linux workstation where the COM
//! plumbing cannot even compile. The Windows STA worker
//! (`bridge/src/ascom_wrapper/camera.rs`) is the only production caller.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! ICameraV3 splits cooling into two properties: `CoolerOn` (a bool) and
//! `SetCCDTemperature` (the setpoint, optional — a driver may reject it and
//! advertises that through `CanSetCCDTemperature`). The setpoint is written
//! *before* `CoolerOn`, so a setpoint write that throws also costs the
//! `CoolerOn` write: on a ZWO ASI178MM (`CanSetCCDTemperature = False`) an
//! invented -10 C on a cooler-off command threw and left the cooler on with
//! no way to switch it off. Two rules fall out, and this module is where they
//! live:
//!
//! 1. **Off needs no setpoint.** Turning a TEC off is a `CoolerOn = false`
//!    write and nothing else.
//! 2. **Never write a property the driver says it does not have.** A camera
//!    reporting `CanSetCCDTemperature = False` must not be sent one.

/// Decide the setpoint (if any) to write to `SetCCDTemperature` before
/// toggling `CoolerOn`.
///
/// * `enabled` — the cooler state being commanded.
/// * `requested` — the setpoint the caller asked for, or `None` when the
///   caller named none. `None` is never turned into a number here; the
///   driver keeps whatever setpoint it already holds.
/// * `can_set_ccd_temperature` — the driver's own `CanSetCCDTemperature`
///   answer, or `None` when that probe itself failed. A failed probe is
///   treated as "do not write": a capability read that errors is not
///   evidence the property exists, and the alternative (write anyway) is the
///   exact call that took the cooler-off path down.
///
/// Returns `Some(setpoint)` only when writing `SetCCDTemperature` is both
/// wanted and permitted.
