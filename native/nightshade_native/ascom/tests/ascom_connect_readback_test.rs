//! Hardware-fixture test for the connect read-back check (finding L4).
//!
//! The pure timing/message policy is unit-tested in `connect_verify`, but those
//! tests pass whether or not `AscomDeviceConnection::connect` actually *calls*
//! it. This file covers that gap: it drives the real production `connect()`
//! against a real COM driver and asserts the connect is refused. Revert the
//! read-back in `windows::connection` and this test fails, because `connect()`
//! goes back to returning `Ok(())`.
//!
//! ## The fixture
//!
//! It needs an ASCOM driver that is *installed but has no hardware behind it* —
//! the exact situation that produced the bug, and one that is completely normal
//! because ASCOM registers drivers independently of devices. On the reference
//! imaging laptop that is `ASCOM.ASIMount.Telescope`: the owner has ZWO
//! cameras, so the ASI mount driver is installed, but there is no ASI mount.
//! Measured 2026-08-09, it accepts `Connected = true` in 54 ms and then reports
//! `Connected = False` indefinitely.
//!
//! Because that fixture is machine-specific, the test is `#[ignore]`d and the
//! ProgID is overridable. Run it on a machine that has such a driver:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p nightshade_ascom --test ascom_connect_readback_test -- --ignored --nocapture
//! NIGHTSHADE_PHANTOM_PROGID=ASCOM.Something.Telescope cargo test ... -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! Do NOT point it at a driver whose hardware is present and powered: that
//! device will connect, and the test will correctly fail.

// Why cfg(windows): `AscomDeviceConnection` and the COM entry points live under
// `#[cfg(windows)]`. On other targets this file compiles to nothing.
#![cfg(windows)]
