//! Synthetic frame generation for the simulator camera.
//!
//! Extracted from the `DriverType::Simulator` download arm so the frame can be
//! run through the REAL star detector in a unit test. That matters more than
//! usual here: every focus, HFR and grading result an operator sees while
//! evaluating Nightshade without hardware is measured against this buffer, so if
//! it is not detectable-star-bearing, those subsystems silently report nothing
//! and the simulator quietly teaches the wrong thing.
//!
//! History: the original buffer was all zeros, which `[IMAGE_VALIDATION]`
//! correctly rejected as a dead frame, so no simulated sequence could run. That
//! was replaced by a faint gradient plus four flat 6x6 blocks of 50,000 ADU —
//! enough to pass validation, but the detector found NONE of them (every frame
//! logged "no stars detected for HFR calculation", autofocus died with
//! "Insufficient stars detected. Only 0 stars found (minimum: 10)", and the
//! HFR-degradation / focus-drift triggers had nothing to measure). Hence the
//! Gaussian field below, plus the tests that hold it to the detector's bar.
//!
//! The gradient that replaced the zeros was itself a defect: `200 + ((x+y)%400)`
//! is a diagonal sawtooth, not noise, and nothing about it moved when exposure,
//! gain or offset changed — an 8 s / gain 0 frame and a 2 s / gain 120 frame were
//! 99.7% bit-identical, spanning 442 of 65,536 ADU. Saturation, clipping, well
//! depth, calibration-frame quality and defect maps therefore could not fire at
//! all, and subtracting such a frame as a master dark injected a diagonal ramp
//! into every calibrated light. The model below is instead built out of
//! electrons: a bias pedestal, dark current and sky that accumulate with
//! exposure, stars that accumulate only on light frames, shot and read noise,
//! and a hard clip at the sensor's advertised ceiling. Charge is collected
//! first and read out once, so binning sums WELLS rather than summing reads —
//! see [`read_out`] for what the earlier ordering cost.
