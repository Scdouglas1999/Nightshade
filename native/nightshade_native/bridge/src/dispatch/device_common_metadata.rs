//! Protocol-neutral "ASCOM-Common" metadata probe trait and shared helper.
//!
//! Every typed device wrapper in this crate — whether the underlying transport
//! is Alpaca (HTTP) or ASCOM (Windows COM) — exposes the same four
//! identification properties:
//!
//! | Method                 | ASCOM-Common endpoint | Returns               |
//! |------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
//! | `interface_version()`  | `InterfaceVersion`    | `i32` (ASCOM Vn)      |
//! | `driver_version()`     | `DriverVersion`       | `String` (vendor str) |
//! | `driver_info()`        | `DriverInfo`          | `String` (vendor str) |
//! | `supported_actions()`  | `SupportedActions`    | `Vec<String>`         |
//!
//! These four properties are defined by the ASCOM standard and are present on
//! every conforming driver regardless of role (camera, mount, focuser, …) or
//! transport. This trait formalizes the shared contract so a single generic
//! helper can replace the per-arm fan-out in both
//! `dispatch/alpaca.rs::query_alpaca_api_version` (10 arms) and
//! `dispatch/ascom.rs::query_ascom_api_version` (7 arms).
//!
//! The actual `impl DeviceCommonMetadata for ...` blocks live next to each
//! protocol's wrappers:
//! * [`crate::dispatch::alpaca_device_common`] — the 10 Alpaca typed wrappers.
//! * [`crate::dispatch::ascom_device_common`] — the 7 ASCOM typed wrappers
//!   (camera, mount, focuser, filter wheel, dome, switch, cover calibrator).
//!
//! # What this trait deliberately does NOT abstract
//!
//! This is the **read-only metadata probe** surface. It is NOT a general
//! "device" trait — it intentionally omits:
//!
//! * **Lifecycle** (`connect`/`disconnect`/`is_connected`) — those exist on
//!   the wrappers but their use is coupled to the bridge's per-device-type
//!   storage maps; abstracting them here would not actually reduce duplication.
//! * **Heartbeat** — Alpaca wrappers expose `heartbeat()` (returns RTT in ms)
//!   for some roles and `is_connected()` for others; ASCOM wrappers vary
//!   between `heartbeat()` returning `()`, returning a typed health enum, and
//!   `get_tracking()`-as-probe for mounts. That heterogeneity is real, not
//!   accidental; forcing it into the trait would smush a genuine distinction.
//! * **Operational properties** (`can_slew`, `camera_x_size`, …) — these
//!   differ per device role and are precisely what makes the typed wrappers
//!   distinct. They belong on the concrete types, not the common trait.
//!
//! # `supported_actions` silent-fallback policy
//!
//! `supported_actions()` is mapped to an empty `Vec` inside [`fetch_api_version`]
//! when the probe fails because per the ASCOM/Alpaca specification, drivers
//! that do not implement the optional `ISupportedActions` interface
//! legitimately return either Alpaca error `0x40C` (`ActionNotImplemented`) or
//! ASCOM `PropertyNotImplementedException` (HRESULT `0x80040400`). The
//! documented semantics for "this driver advertises no custom actions" is an
//! empty list, which is exactly what `Vec::default()` provides. Per the
//! project's "Errors are a feature" policy, we make this not-silent by
//! emitting a `tracing::warn!` so the discarded error is observable in logs
//! even though it does not propagate. The 17x `unwrap_or_default()` calls
//! flagged by the original audit (10 Alpaca + 7 ASCOM) collapse into one
//! loud-on-loss site.

/// `mpsc` so the `&self` receiver suffices despite the underlying COM
/// apartment being single-threaded.

/// `build` is the protocol-specific constructor —

/// [`DeviceApiVersion::from_ascom`] for ASCOM devices. Both constructors
/// share the same signature; only the `DriverType` tag and `protocol_version`
/// field differ, so the probe body is identical and the closure parameter is
/// the only thing that varies across the two call sites.
///
/// # Silent-fallback semantics
///
/// * `interface_version` → `1` (ASCOM V1 baseline) when the probe fails. The
///   ASCOM spec mandates that every conforming driver implements at least V1
///   for its device type, so this is the floor not a guess.
/// * `driver_version` / `driver_info` → `None` when the probe fails. The UI
///   renders missing values as "Unknown".
/// * `supported_actions` → empty `Vec` when the probe fails, with a
///   `tracing::warn!` carrying the discarded error so the loss is loud per
///   CLAUDE.md "errors are a feature". The documented ASCOM-optional default
///   semantics ("driver has no custom actions") are preserved.
///
/// Errors here are not surfaced as `Err` because at the call site any
/// individual probe failure is already documented (per the module docstring)
/// as a valid "missing optional property" signal — propagating it would break
/// the equipment-compatibility-matrix UI for partially-conforming drivers.
/// Connection-absence is still a hard `Err` at the dispatch layer above.
