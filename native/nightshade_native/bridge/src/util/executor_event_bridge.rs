//! Wave 1.5 Pack A: bridge ExecutorEvents from one-shot bridge-API instruction
//! sites (e.g. `api_autofocus`, `api_start_polar_alignment`) into the bridge's
//! shared NightshadeEvent bus.
//!
//! ## Why
//!
//! Several bridge-side APIs construct an `InstructionContext` directly to run
//! a single sequencer instruction outside the live `SequenceExecutor` —
//! examples include the standalone autofocus API and the polar-alignment
//! routine. Those code paths previously passed `event_tx: None` into the
//! context, which silently dropped instruction-level emergencies such as
//! FITS-save failures: the user never saw them, only the tracing log did.
//!
//! The live sequencer already has its own broadcast channel (see
//! `SequenceExecutor::event_tx`). For the one-shot bridge sites we need an
//! adapter: a freshly-created `broadcast::Sender<ExecutorEvent>` whose
//! receiver pumps incoming events into `state.publish_event(...)` using the
//! existing `SequencerEvent::Error` payload so Dart subscribers see them on
//! the same NightshadeEvent stream as a live-sequence error.
//!
//! ## Lifetime
//!
//! `spawn_executor_event_bridge` returns a `broadcast::Sender<ExecutorEvent>`.
//! Hand it (cloned) into the `event_tx` field of the InstructionContext. The
//! background task lives as long as at least one sender clone exists; once the
//! caller drops the context and the original sender, the task exits cleanly.
//!
//! ## Error vs. info routing
//!
//! `ExecutorEvent::Error` -> `EventSeverity::Error` + `SequencerEvent::Error`.
//! Every other variant is currently re-emitted at `EventSeverity::Info` with a
//! `SequencerEvent::Error { message: "…" }` payload describing the event —
//! the one-shot sites don't have a richer payload mapping today and the
//! existing UI consumer (`SequenceExecutor._handleSequencerEvent`) treats the
//! `Error` SequencerEvent as the catch-all log line. This keeps the wiring
//! visible without inventing new typed payloads (which would require an FRB
//! regen and a separate UI handler).
