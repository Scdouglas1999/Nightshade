/// Blocking receive that keeps this STA thread's Win32 message queue pumped
/// while it waits for the next command.
///
/// ASCOM drivers are STA COM objects. Many service their hardware through a
/// hidden message-only window: filter-wheel moves, camera state transitions,
/// and other async property completions arrive as window messages. The desktop
/// GUI drains those via its own event loop, but a headless worker thread parked
/// in [`tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver::blocking_recv`] never pumps messages — so
/// those operations stall, silently no-op, or surface as `DISP_E_EXCEPTION`
/// (`0x80020009`). Draining the queue on a short poll restores GUI-equivalent
/// behaviour WITHOUT weakening the single-threaded-apartment invariant: the
/// driver is still only ever touched from this one thread.
///
/// Returns `None` when the command channel is closed (all senders dropped),
/// matching [`tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver::blocking_recv`] so callers keep
/// their `while let Some(cmd) = ...` loop shape unchanged.
