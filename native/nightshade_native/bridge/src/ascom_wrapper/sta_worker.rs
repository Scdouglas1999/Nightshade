//! Process-wide persistent single-threaded-apartment (STA) worker for ASCOM COM.
//!
//! # Why one apartment
//!
//! ASCOM drivers are Win32 STA COM objects. Every COM property/method call on a
//! driver MUST happen on the thread that called `CoInitializeEx(STA)` and that
//! thread MUST run a real Windows message pump, because many drivers service
//! their hardware through a hidden message-only window (filter-wheel moves,
//! camera state transitions, async-property completions all arrive as window
//! messages). The desktop GUI gives the process a pump via Flutter's event loop;
//! the headless appliance has none. That single gap is the root cause behind the
//! beta-gap bugs:
//!
//! * a driver pops a modal dialog at connect and nothing is there to dismiss it
//!   (the appliance hangs forever);
//! * `CoCreateInstance` / `Connected = true` run on a pumpless thread;
//! * a property-put (filter-wheel `Position`) is posted to a window that is
//!   never pumped, so the move silently no-ops;
//! * heartbeat reads accumulate failures and the device is marked unhealthy.
//!
//! This module owns ONE apartment for the whole process lifetime. It calls
//! [`init_com`] exactly once, creates a hidden message-only window so the
//! apartment has a real pump target, and runs a single loop that (a) drains the
//! Win32 message queue every tick and (b) round-robins every registered device's
//! command channel. A device's COM object is created on this thread and is only
//! ever touched from this thread; it never crosses an apartment boundary.
//!
//! # Design vs. the per-device-thread predecessor
//!
//! The previous design spawned one `std::thread` per connected device, each with
//! its own `CoInitializeEx`/apartment and its own pump-and-block loop. That left
//! the process with N independent apartments and, crucially, did its
//! `CoCreateInstance` outside any running pump. Collapsing to a single hosted
//! apartment keeps every device's command-handling body byte-identical (each
//! wrapper still owns its typed `mpsc` command channel and its `match cmd`
//! arms) while the head-of-line cost of serialising all COM onto one thread is
//! accepted per the 6.0 plan — the wrappers already use the async ASCOM variants
//! (`SlewToCoordinatesAsync`, poll-based `StartExposure`) so steady-state work
//! per command is short.
//!
//! Everything here is Windows-only; the parent `ascom_wrapper` module is
//! `#[cfg(windows)]`, so this file is never compiled or tested on Linux.
