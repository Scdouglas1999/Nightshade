//! The Darkroom's process-global state: the operation registry, the render
//! cache, the base-master pyramid cache, and the render cancellation flags.
//!
//! # Why the Darkroom holds process state when post-session holds none
//!
//! The post-session pipeline is stateless per call so it can run beside the live
//! stacker. The Darkroom is the opposite shape: an editor drags a parameter and
//! re-renders the same recipe over the same master tens of times a second, and
//! the whole point of the step-boundary cache is that the work below the edited
//! step is *not* repeated. A cache that lived per call would never hit. The
//! state here is therefore the cache, the registry it renders with, and the
//! flags a render polls — never a half-finished image.
//!
//! # Lock order
//!
//! The base-cache lock is never held while the render-cache lock is held.
//! [`base_pyramid`] takes and releases the base lock before its caller takes the
//! render lock, so the two can never deadlock against each other.
//!
//! # Serialisation
//!
//! One render holds the render-cache lock for its duration, so renders run one
//! at a time. That is the shared-cache contract, not an accident: two renders
//! interleaving inserts against one budget would evict each other's boundaries.
//!
//! # Byte budgets
//!
//! Both caches are byte-budgeted and evict least-recently-used entries first.
//! Eviction changes only how much work a render repeats; it never changes
//! pixels.
