//! What calibration was actually applied to a group's lights, and how well it
//! matched them.
//!
//! The matcher that *chooses* a dark/flat/bias runs in Dart; this module states
//! the consequences of that choice from the files themselves. Every comparison
//! reads the master's own FITS header against the group's anchor light, so the
//! report describes the bytes that were subtracted and divided, not the
//! intentions of whoever picked them.
//!
//! Three rules the shape enforces:
//!
//! * A calibration type with no master is an explicit entry
//!   ([`MatchQuality::Missing`]), never an omission.
//! * A dimension that could not be compared — either side missing the keyword —
//!   lands in [`AppliedMaster::unverified`] instead of counting as a match.
//! * Staleness is measured, not assumed: an in-date master, an out-of-date one
//!   and one whose date is unknown each read differently.
