/// frame's `EXPTIME` — the one FITS keyword calibration and stacking tools trust
/// most. It was a hardcoded `1.0`, so every simulated frame claimed a 1-second
/// exposure regardless of what the sequence asked for.
///
/// `frame_type` and `subframe` live here for the same reason: the download op
/// takes only a device id, so without them a DARK was generated as a star field
/// and announced itself as a light, and a subframe request came back full-frame.

/// to try to bridge it anyway, and it cannot: `frame_type` is
/// `nightshade_native::camera::FrameType`, which the generator resolves by bare
/// name to the unrelated `crate::device::FrameType`, emitting a
/// `frb_generated.rs` that does not compile. The committed generated file
