//! Unified Device Operations Implementation
//!
//! This module is the one and only `DeviceOps` implementation the sequencer
//! runs against. Nothing may add a second one: `set_device_ops` on the
//! process-global executor is last-writer-wins, so two impls means whichever
//! registered last silently owns every device call.
//!
//! # Architecture

//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use nightshade_bridge::unified_device_ops::create_unified_device_ops;
//!
//! let ops = create_unified_device_ops();
//! executor.set_device_ops(ops);
//! ```
//!
//! # `as`-cast policy
//!
//! Same pattern groupings as `sequencer_ops.rs` (this file is the unified
//! replacement and the cast taxonomy is identical):
//! - **Pixel histogram u16 → usize index** (line 548): u16 max 65535 fits
//!   any supported usize.
//! - **Image normalize u16 → f64** (line 505): exact widening.
//! - **bool → u8** (lines 660, 904): wire encoding.
//! - **Filter wheel index ±1** (lines 815, 817): bounded by slot count.
//! - **star_count usize → u32** (line 544): real frames have ≤ tens of
//!   thousands of stars; saturating cast would catch any pathology.
//! - **Star-count average f64** (line 1300): exact widening.
//! - **Julian Day chrono fields**: computed by
//!   `sequencer/src/meridian.rs::julian_day`, where the per-site reasoning
//!   lives.

/// Prefix marking a capture that failed *image validation* rather than failing
/// in the driver or the transport.
///
/// The `DeviceOps` trait signs its errors as bare `String` (`DeviceResult<T> =
/// Result<T, String>`), so a caller cannot otherwise tell "the camera worked and
/// the frame is unusable" apart from "the camera broke". That distinction
/// matters at the HTTP boundary: a completely saturated frame is a normal,
/// operator-actionable outcome (shorten the exposure) and must not be reported
/// as an internal server fault. `api::imaging` matches this prefix to promote
/// the error to [`NightshadeError::ExposureFailed`], which the headless API maps
/// to 422 instead of 500.
///
/// Producer and consumer live in the same crate and share this constant so the
/// two cannot drift apart.
