//! The one place a simulated camera frame is produced.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! There were two simulated-capture paths and only one rendered the sky:
//!
//! * the sequencer / DeviceManager download
//!   (`device_manager::ops::camera`) built a [`crate::sim_frame::SimFrameRequest`]
//!   carrying a [`SimSkyView`] and rendered the real catalogue field, while
//!   * the Imaging screen's manual capture (`api::imaging`) took a
//!     `device_id.starts_with("sim_")` shortcut into a `rand::thread_rng()`
//!     star painter that scattered stars at random positions.
//!
//! The consequence was measured, not theorised: two consecutive
//! `POST /api/camera/expose` captures at an identical mount pointing shared
//! ZERO of their 40 brightest stars, and ASTAP (D05 installed, correct hint)
//! detected 151 stars in the result and still reported `No solution found!`
//! at every FOV from 9.5 deg down to 0.4 deg. Anything that plate-solves —
//! Slew & Center, the framing wizard, mosaic tiles, meridian-flip recentre,
//! polar alignment — was therefore unexercisable offline even though the
//! renderer itself worked.
//!
//! Both callers now enter here, so a frame the sequencer can solve is the same
//! frame the Imaging screen gets. `sim_capture_has_no_rival_star_generator` in
//! this module fails the build if a third path is ever added.
