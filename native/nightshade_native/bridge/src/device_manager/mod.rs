//! Device Manager with connection state management and auto-reconnection
//!
//! Provides a unified interface for managing device connections across
//! different driver backends (ASCOM, Alpaca, INDI, Native vendor SDKs).
//!
//! This module is the residual shell: it holds the `DeviceManager` and
//! `ManagedDevice` struct definitions, configuration types, constructors, and
//! lightweight query helpers (`get_all_devices`, `get_devices_by_type`,
//! `get_device`, `is_connected`). Heavier method groups live in sibling
//! submodules using Rust's split-impl-block feature:
//!
//! - `connection` — `register_device`, `connect_device`, `disconnect_device`,
//!   `reconnection_loop`, `set_auto_reconnect`, `report_error`, `shutdown`,
//!   `unregister_device`.
//! - `api_version` — cached `DeviceApiVersion` access + `query_*` dispatch +
//!   `device_supports_*` predicates.
//! - Per-driver `connect_*` and `query_*_api_version` helpers live in
//!   `crate::dispatch::{ascom,alpaca,indi,native}`.
