//! Fault injection for the device simulators.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The simulators were *only* capable of succeeding. Across 1753 lines,
//! `api/devices/simulation.rs` contained nine `Err(` returns, and every one of
//! them was a "you forgot to connect" gate — never a device that connected,
//! answered, and then misbehaved. Real gear misbehaves constantly: an ASCOM
//! driver returns `0x80020009` for a property it does not implement, a USB
//! camera stops answering mid-download, a filter wheel accepts `set_position`
//! and never arrives, a focuser reports the position it was *asked* for rather
//! than the one it reached.
//!
//! A simulator that can only succeed fails in the pass-making direction: the
//! whole test suite stays green while every error path in the app above it goes
//! unexercised. That is the most dangerous shape a test double can have,
//! because green is read as evidence. Every fault below corresponds to a real
//! failure observed against real hardware on this project (see
//! `docs/` live-rig notes: rotator `VT_R4`, the aux heartbeat, ASCOM retry,
//! gain-not-implemented, the INDI BLOB download timeout).
//!
//! # What a fault is
//!
//! A [`FaultSpec`] is a (trigger, effect) pair armed against an operation key
//! such as `"mount.slew"`. The gate helpers in [`super::sim_gate`] consult the
//! registry before doing their normal work, so arming a fault needs no changes
//! at any call site.
//!
//! Faults are **deterministic by default**. `Probability` exists for soak runs
//! and is driven by a seeded xorshift, so a chaos run is replayable from its
//! seed rather than being un-debuggable. Nothing here calls a system RNG or the
//! clock for its decisions.
//!
//! # Arming
//!
//! - From Rust (tests): [`arm`], [`clear`], [`clear_all`].
//! - From a live drive, without a rebuild: the `NIGHTSHADE_SIM_FAULTS`
//!   environment variable, parsed by [`arm_from_env`]. See [`parse_spec_list`]
//!   for the grammar.
//!
//! # Stalls are not errors
//!
//! [`Effect::Stall`] deliberately returns `Ok(())`. A stalled mount, filter
//! wheel or focuser is the *hardest* real failure for software to handle
//! because nothing reports an error — the command is accepted and the device
//! simply never arrives. The app has to notice via timeout. Returning `Err`
//! here would test the easy path and skip the one that loses a night, so the
//! effect instead sets a latch that the simulator's motion advancers consult
//! (see [`is_stalled`]).
