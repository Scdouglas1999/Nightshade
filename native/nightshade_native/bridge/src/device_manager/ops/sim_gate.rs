//! Simulator connection-gate helpers (DEV-P3-3 follow-up).
//!
//! `device_manager::connection::connect_simulator` flips the matching
//! `simulation.rs` singleton's `connected` flag, but the per-op dispatchers
//! in `ops/{camera,mount,focuser,filter_wheel,rotator,...}.rs` previously
//! ignored that flag and returned hardcoded `Ok(value)` constants for every
//! `DriverType::Simulator` arm. That made the singleton's `connected`
//! state essentially decorative — a "disconnected" simulator still answered
//! every read with synthetic data, hiding bugs where the UI thought it
//! had an attached device when it did not.
//!
//! This module funnels every simulator op through one of two policies:
//!
//! 1. **Gated read** (`with_*_status`): consult the singleton; if
//!    `connected == true`, hand the caller a snapshot of the status
//!    struct and let it project whatever field it needs. If
//!    `connected == false`, return a descriptive `Err` so the caller
//!    surfaces the same fail-loud signal as a real driver that lost
//!    its handle.
//! 2. **Gated write** (`require_*_connected`): used by mutating ops
//!    (set/move/park/halt) that the singleton does not literally model
//!    but which still need to refuse to "succeed" when the simulator
//!    isn't connected. Returns `Ok(())` on connected, `Err` otherwise.
//!
//! Device types without a singleton (dome, cover, safety monitor, switch,
//! weather) are NOT served by this module — those ops emit the existing
//! "Simulator devices are disabled" fail-loud error (camera.rs:1591 style)
//! directly. Adding singletons for those device types is tracked separately
//! and intentionally out of scope here (no stubs).
//!
//! Errors are a feature. Every error returned from this module
//! names the simulator device type so the failure message points the user
//! at "connect first" rather than at an opaque `Ok(0)` that misled them
//! about whether the call succeeded.
