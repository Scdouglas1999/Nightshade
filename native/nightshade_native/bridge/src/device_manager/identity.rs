//! Device identity read back from a live driver after connect.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Every transport Nightshade speaks addresses devices by **position**, not by
//! identity:
//!
//! * native vendor SDKs: `native:zwo:1` is the ASI SDK's enumeration index.
//!   `ASIGetCameraProperty(&info, i)` returns `info.CameraID == i`, so the
//!   "resolve the stable CameraID" loop in `ZwoCamera::load_camera_info` is
//!   re-deriving the index it was given.
//! * ASCOM: `ASCOM.ASICamera2.Camera` is a driver **slot**. Which body answers
//!   it depends on what is plugged in.
//!
//! Measured on the reference rig (two ZWO cameras, ASI SDK 1.40) the native
//! index re-ordered across a replug:
//!
//! | id | before | after |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `native:zwo:0` | ZWO ASI178MM | ZWO ASI1600MM-Cool |
//! | `native:zwo:1` | ZWO ASI1600MM-Cool | ZWO ASI178MM |
//!
//! A run started on `native:zwo:1` believing it was the 1600 captured the whole
//! session on the 178MM. Nothing in the app noticed, because all three things
//! that could have revealed it were absent: the id did not change, the
//! displayed name was derived from the id rather than the driver, and the
//! capabilities were never re-read.
//!
//! # What this module does about it
//!
//! [`DeviceIdentity`] is what a driver says about itself once it is open. The
//! device manager records it on the first successful connect and compares it on
//! every subsequent connect for the same id. A contradiction means the id now
//! points at different hardware, which is refused rather than imaged.
//!
//! # Why identity is a fingerprint and not just a serial
//!
//! A serial would be ideal, and the ASI SDK does expose one — but not for every
//! body. On the reference rig `ASIGetSerialNumber` succeeds for the ASI178MM and
//! answers `ASI_ERROR_GENERAL_ERROR` for the ASI1600MM-Cool, which is the
//! owner's primary imaging camera. A serial-only scheme would therefore protect
//! the camera that matters least. So identity is layered: serial when the
//! hardware offers one, and otherwise the model name plus the sensor geometry,
//! which is what actually differs between two bodies a user is likely to
//! confuse (4656x3520 @ 3.80um vs 3096x2080 @ 2.40um for exactly the pair
//! above).
