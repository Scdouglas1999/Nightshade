//! Device Capability Reporting
//!
//! This module provides standardized capability reporting for all device types.
//! Capabilities describe what operations a device supports, allowing the UI
//! and sequencer to adapt to device limitations.
//!
//! # Connect/Disconnect-probe guard
//!
//! A capability probe for an Alpaca or ASCOM device probes `is_connected()`
//! before it touches the connection, because a blind
//! `connect → read properties → disconnect` cycle drops a session the user
//! already has open in the UI.
//!
//! * `Ok(true)` — the device is already up: read the properties and issue no
//!   connect/disconnect.
//! * `Ok(false)` — run the full connect/probe/disconnect cycle.
//! * `Err` (the driver does not implement `Connected`, or the call failed
//!   mid-transition) — treat the device as already connected.
//!
//! `Err` resolves that way because the two mistakes are not symmetric:
//! skipping a disconnect leaves a short-lived connection the device manager
//! cleans up on its normal lifecycle, while issuing one against a driver
//! mid-operation can corrupt a live exposure or slew.
//!
//! # `as`-cast policy
//!
//! All `as` casts in this file are capability-probe widenings:
//! - **Sensor i32 → u32** (ASCOM `CameraXSize` / `CameraYSize`): int per spec
//!   and ≥ 1 physically; `unwrap_or(0)` on the optional probe maps a
//!   missing/failed read to 0, which the UI renders as "unknown".
//! - **usize → i32 filter count**: physical filter wheels have ≤ 16 slots, so
//!   saturation at `i32::MAX` is unreachable.
//! - **i32 → i32 filter position**: a no-op widening kept for clarity around
//!   the `.map(|p| p as i32)` Option-mapping idiom.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! let caps = api_get_mount_capabilities(mount_id).await?;
//! if caps.can_pulse_guide {
//!     // Enable PHD2-style guiding
//! }
//! ```

/// Re-read the LIVE readings that share the capability structs, overwriting
/// whatever the cache is holding for them.
///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// The capability structs mix two very different kinds of value: static
/// feature flags (`can_park`, `max_bin_x`, `position_count`) that only change
/// when hardware is swapped, and live readings (`ccd_temperature`,
/// `cooler_on`, `current_position`, `is_moving`, `is_safe`) that change every
/// second. [`CAPABILITY_CACHE_TTL`] is 5 minutes, so the live readings were
/// being served up to 5 minutes stale — as a confident, unqualified value.
///
/// Measured on the live rig against a real ZWO ASI1600MM-Cool and ZWO EFW:
/// after `POST /api/camera/cooling {"enabled":true,"targetTemp":10}`,
/// `GET /api/equipment/camera/capabilities` kept reporting
/// `coolerOn: false, setCcdTemperature: -10, ccdTemperature: 14.8,
/// coolerPower: 0` for **259 seconds** while `GET /api/camera/cooling`
/// correctly showed the cooler on, the setpoint at 10 °C, the sensor falling
/// 14.8 → 10.1 °C and the cooler drawing up to 11 %. It flipped to the truth
/// at t=275 s, matching the TTL. Identically, the filter wheel reported
/// `currentPosition: 0` across four consecutive polls while the wheel was
/// physically at slot 7 and both `/api/filter-wheel/position` and
/// `/api/equipment/filter-wheel/status` correctly said 7.
///
/// The cache is still worth keeping: for ASCOM/Alpaca the *static* probe can
/// connect and disconnect the driver (see the module header), which is what
/// must not run on every poll. Re-reading a single live value uses the same
/// always-live device-manager accessors the `/api/equipment/*/status`
/// endpoints already poll at 500 ms, so it adds no new access pattern.
///
/// Failures leave the cached value untouched: this exists to remove stale
/// readings, not to introduce a new way for a capability read to fail.
///
/// Not covered: [`DeviceCapabilities::Switch`] — refreshing it needs one
/// round trip per switch, and [`WeatherCapabilities`] has no live fields.
