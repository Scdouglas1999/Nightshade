//! DepthLock on the host: durable goals, the analysis queue, and the hooks
//! that connect them to the capture path and the executor.
//!
//! Layering:
//! - `nightshade_imaging::depthlock` measures and decides (pure).
//! - [`store`] keeps goals and evidence durable and revision-checked.
//! - [`engine`] turns saved frames into evidence, commits analyses, and
//!   answers the executor's verdict queries.
//! - `crate::api::depthlock` exposes it to Dart; `crate::api::sequencer`'s
//!   event loop feeds it saved frames.
