//! The host-side DepthLock service: a bounded analysis queue over the goal
//! store, the per-frame ingestion pipeline, and the verdict source the
//! executor consults.
//!
//! One worker drains the queue; each job runs on the blocking pool so the
//! numerical work never sits on an async thread. When the queue is full the
//! newest job is shed with an event rather than delaying the capture path
//! that produced it — the frame is already on disk and can be re-ingested.
//! Everything that touches a goal goes through the store's revision checks,
//! so a job that outlives a goal edit commits nothing.
