//! ASCOM `SensorType` → Bayer element order.
//!
//! ASCOM ICameraV3 defines `SensorType` as 0 Monochrome, 1 Color, 2 RGGB,
//! 3 CMYG, 4 CMYG2, 5 LRGB. The ordinal names the colour-filter *family*, never
//! the element order: every RGGB-family mosaic reports 2, and which corner of
//! the 2×2 block holds red is carried only by `BayerOffsetX`/`BayerOffsetY`.
//! Type 1 is a direct-colour sensor with no Bayer mask, so its offsets name
//! nothing; types 3..=5 are mosaics with no RGGB-style order to name.
//!
//! Deriving a pattern from the family ordinal alone transposes red and blue on
//! a BGGR or GRBG sensor and writes the wrong `BAYERPAT` into the FITS header,
//! and neither is recoverable from the saved frame. `None` therefore means "the
//! pattern is unknown", which leaves the frame undebayered and the `BAYERPAT`
//! card unwritten rather than debayered wrongly.
//!
//! Both ASCOM transports carry this same enum — the Windows COM worker in
//! `ascom_wrapper` and the Alpaca HTTP download path — so the mapping lives
//! here, compiled and regression-tested on every platform.
