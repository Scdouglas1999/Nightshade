//! ZWO ASI Camera SDK Wrapper
//!
//! Provides native support for ZWO ASI cameras by wrapping the ASI SDK.
//! The SDK is typically provided as a DLL (Windows) or shared library (macOS/Linux).
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//!
//! The ASI SDK is NOT thread-safe. All SDK operations are protected by per-SDK
//! mutexes from `crate::sync`:
//! - `zwo_camera_mutex()` - ASI Camera SDK (ASICamera2.dll)
//! - `zwo_eaf_mutex()` - EAF Focuser SDK (EAF_focuser.dll)
//! - `zwo_efw_mutex()` - EFW Filter Wheel SDK (EFW_filter.dll)
//!
//! ## Timeout Handling
//!
//! All SDK operations that can potentially hang (exposure polling, image download,
//! focuser moves, filter wheel moves) have configurable timeouts via `NativeTimeoutConfig`.
//! Use the helper methods like `wait_for_exposure_complete`, `move_focuser_with_timeout`,
//! and `move_filterwheel_with_timeout` to ensure operations don't block indefinitely.

// c_long is i32 on Windows and i64 on Linux (LP64), so the `as i32` casts on
// SDK control values are identity on one platform and a real (documented,
// range-checked-by-contract) narrowing on the other. clippy::unnecessary_cast
// fires on whichever platform the cast is the identity — allow it file-wide
// rather than decorating every site; each cast carries its own comment.
#![allow(clippy::unnecessary_cast)]
#![allow(dead_code)] // FFI types must match SDK headers even if not all variants are used

// =============================================================================
// CONNECTED-DEVICE REGISTRIES (EAF + EFW)
// =============================================================================
//
// Purpose: prevent hot-plug discovery polls from calling EAFOpen/EAFClose (or
// EFWOpen/EFWClose) on device IDs that are already held open by a live session.
// The ZWO SDKs share a single OS-level handle per device ID; calling Close on
// a connected device's ID closes the session's handle, causing the next SDK
// call from the session to return EAF_ERROR_CLOSED (9) / EFW_ERROR_CLOSED (9),
// which surfaces as spurious "Heartbeat failure" warnings in the UI.
//
// Lock ordering rule (must be respected everywhere to prevent deadlock):
//   Registry lock  MUST NOT be held while acquiring the SDK mutex.
//   Acquire registry lock → read/copy entry → RELEASE registry lock → then
//   acquire SDK mutex if needed. Discovery acquires the SDK mutex first (before
//   reading the registry), so inside the discovery loop the SDK mutex is
//   already held; acquiring the registry lock there (briefly, no SDK call
//   while holding it) is safe because the registry lock is never taken in the
//   other direction (registry → then SDK mutex).
//
// Both registries use std::sync::Mutex (not tokio::sync::Mutex) because all
// accesses are brief, synchronous, non-blocking, and must not span await points.

/// Cached EAF discovery metadata stored for a connected focuser.
/// Mirrors the fields of `ZwoFocuserDiscoveryInfo` exactly so discovery can
/// reconstruct a complete entry without opening the device.
