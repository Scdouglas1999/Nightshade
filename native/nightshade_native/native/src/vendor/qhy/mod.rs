//! QHY Camera SDK Wrapper
//!
//! Provides native support for QHY cameras by wrapping the QHY SDK.
//! QHY cameras support advanced features like readout modes and sensor chamber readings.
//!
//! ## Thread Safety
//!
//! The QHY SDK is NOT thread-safe. All SDK operations are protected by `qhy_mutex()`
//! from `crate::sync` to prevent concurrent access. Note that QHY filter wheels (CFW)
//! are controlled through the camera SDK, so they share the same mutex.
//!
//! ## Timeout Handling
//!
//! All SDK operations that can potentially hang (exposure polling, image download)
//! have configurable timeouts via `NativeTimeoutConfig`.
//!
//! ## Safety Measures for Discovery
//!
//! The QHY SDK has been known to crash or hang during device enumeration on certain
//! systems. This module includes several safety measures:
//!
//! 1. **Enable/Disable Flag**: Discovery can be globally disabled if it causes issues
//! 2. **Panic Protection**: Discovery is wrapped in `catch_unwind` to prevent crashes
//! 3. **Timeout**: Discovery has a configurable timeout (default 10 seconds)
//! 4. **Mutex Serialization**: All discovery calls are serialized via `qhy_mutex()`
//! 5. **Quirks Integration**: Discovery respects quirks from the vendor database

#![allow(dead_code)] // FFI types must match SDK headers even if not all variants are used
