//! Wave 4: Recovery Mode — first-class executor state machine.
//!
//! When a trigger or instruction returns a *recoverable* failure (guide-star
//! lost, slew failed, plate-solve failed, weather unsafe, etc.) the executor
//! transitions `Running` -> `Recovering` and drives a retry loop here. The
//! whole reason for promoting recovery to first-class status is user
//! visibility: SGP's killer feature is that an unattended user can see at a
//! glance the rig is *recovering* rather than dead or running fine. Pre-Wave-4
//! Nightshade had only `RecoveryAction` variants and a buried per-action
//! retry — none of it surfaced to the UI.
