//! Wizard infrastructure: a shared base for stepped automation routines.
//!
//! # What is a "wizard"?
//!
//! A *wizard* in Nightshade is a multi-step automation routine that follows
//! the pattern "for each step in a plan: do work, emit progress, check
//! cancellation, optionally record resumable state, repeat." The four
//! production wizards today are:
//!
//! * `FlatWizard` — iterates exposure trials in a binary search to converge
//!   on a target ADU.
//! * `Mosaic` — validates / computes a panel grid (today: a single
//!   compute step; future: per-panel slew + center + expose).
//! * `PolarAlignment` — measures three sky positions, then enters an
//!   adjustment refinement loop.
//! * `AllSkyPolar` — captures a baseline frame, then loops on drift-pair
//!   refinement.
//!
//! Before this module existed, each wizard hand-rolled its own progress
//! emission, cancellation polling, and (in the case of FlatWizard) had no
//! way to resume mid-execution. This module provides:
//!
//! * The [`Wizard`] trait — wizards plug in by listing their steps and
//!   describing how to execute one step. Wizards may run a fixed plan
//!   (mosaic, polar alignment) or extend the plan dynamically based on
//!   step results (flat wizard's binary search, all-sky polar's
//!   adjustment loop).
//! * The [`WizardExecutor`] — drives a `Wizard` through its plan,
//!   handling cancellation, progress callbacks, and step-level
//!   checkpointing.
//! * The [`WizardCheckpoint`] schema — JSON-serializable record of
//!   completed step indices for a given wizard instance, lifted into
//!   [`crate::checkpoint::SessionCheckpoint::wizard_states`] so a
//!   sequence that was killed mid-wizard can pick up at the next
//!   uncompleted step on resume.
//!
//! # User-visible behavior
//!
//! Wrapping a wizard in [`WizardExecutor`] **does not change its outputs**.
//! FITS files, UI events, plate-solve callbacks, final `InstructionResult`
//! payload, and step ordering are all preserved. The executor adds:
//!
//! * Uniform `"Step X/Y: <description>"` progress messages.
//! * Pre-step cancellation checks.
//! * Optional persistence of completed step indices through
//!   [`WizardCheckpointSink`].
//!
//! Each wizard remains free to emit its own fine-grained progress
//! callbacks **inside** [`Wizard::execute_step`] (e.g. flat wizard's
//! "Iteration 5/10: testing 0.42s exposure"). The executor's progress
//! emission is in addition to, not in place of, those.
//!
//! # Plugin extensibility
//!
//! A future plugin that wants to author a new wizard implements [`Wizard`]
//! for its config type and delegates to a [`WizardExecutor`]. It then gets
//! progress, cancellation, and resume support "for free" without having
//! to reimplement those concerns. See `wizard_test_support` in this
//! module for an example.
