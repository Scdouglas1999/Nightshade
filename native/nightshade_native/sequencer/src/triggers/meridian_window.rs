//! The meridian-flip window test — one implementation for every caller that
//! has to answer "does this target need a flip right now?".
//!
//! The question has exactly two inputs: the TARGET's signed hour angle and the
//! mount's reported pier side. It was previously answered by four hand-written
//! copies of the same `match` (the `MinutesPastMeridian` arm, the
//! `HourAngleThreshold` arm, `TriggerState::meridian_flip_status`, and the
//! exposure gate's "mirror the trigger's own logic exactly" comment), which is
//! how the sign convention drifts: any one of them can be edited east-of-
//! meridian-permissive on its own.

/// Whether the mount is still on the side of the pier that a flip would move
/// it OFF — i.e. whether a flip is meaningful at all right now.
///
/// `hour_angle_hours` is the hour angle of the TARGET, signed and normalized
/// to `[-12, +12]` by [`crate::meridian::hour_angle`]: NEGATIVE is east of the
/// meridian (the target has not transited yet), positive is west of it.
///
/// Two rules, in this order:
///
///  1. **An east target never flips.** A German equatorial approaching the
///     meridian from the east is already in the configuration it needs; a flip
///     there swings the tube through half a turn for nothing, and every
///     post-flip step (re-centre, refocus, guider settle) runs against a
///     target that will not transit for hours. This rule is unconditional and
///     is checked FIRST, so no pier-side reading can talk the decision into
///     firing east of transit. In particular it is never softened into an
///     `abs()` test, which would make the trigger quiet only near transit and
///     fire on everything far enough east.
///  2. **Pier East is the post-flip side.** A mount that already reports
///     `pierEast` has flipped (or started the night on that side) and must not
///     flip again; `has_flipped_this_target` covers the same ground for the
///     run that performed the flip, and this covers a resume that did not.
///
/// `Unknown` — the reading a simulator and many legacy mounts give — is NOT
/// treated as evidence of anything. It falls through to the signed hour-angle
/// rule alone, which is the honest reading: the flip design's decisive input
/// is where the target is, and pier side only ever SUPPRESSES a flip that the
/// hour angle would otherwise justify. Unknown therefore neither blocks a
/// genuine past-the-meridian flip nor manufactures one east of transit.
///
/// A non-finite hour angle (no location, degenerate coordinates) is treated as
/// "cannot evaluate" and never fires.
