    // read it straight off `ImageData` — so preferring the plan here would
    // CHANGE what lands in every FITS file, which is the larger unannounced

    // and the measured value is the one a later calibration match wants.

    // one lying driver could corrupt a season of totals with nothing
    // downstream able to tell. The shutter cannot have been open materially
