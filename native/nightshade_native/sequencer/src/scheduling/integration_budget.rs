//! Wave 3 Agent 3 — Per-target integration budget accounting.
//!
//! The TargetHeader runtime (`node::logic::target_header`) installs one
//! [`BudgetState`] per target on the executor's [`BudgetRegistry`] when
//! entering a target with `TargetHeaderConfig::integration_budget()` set.
//!
//! The exposure instruction (`node::instructions::expose`) calls
//! [`BudgetRegistry::record_exposure`] after every successful burst,
//! crediting the burst's wall-clock seconds to the active target and
//! active filter. The next time the TargetHeader checks the budget — at
//! each child boundary — [`BudgetState::is_met`] becomes true and the
//! target completes Success without imaging the remaining children.
//!
//! State is cheap (one `HashMap<String, f64>` per target plus a flag).
//! Lookups are O(1); the registry is keyed by `target_id` (the
//! TargetHeader node id) so the registry survives across multiple
//! TargetHeader entries in the same sequence (e.g. a Loop wrapping a
//! TargetHeader resumes the existing state).
