//! Image Grading: per-frame metadata bundle carried into `save_fits`.
//!
//! Audit complaint: the pre-existing `save_fits` took only four positional
//! fields (target name, filter, RA, Dec). Standard astrophotography FITS
//! headers want session ID, panel index, observer, focuser position, sensor
//! temp, rotator angle, guide RMS, plate-solve coords, Bayer pattern, observer
//! site coordinates, telescope/camera identification. The
//! [`MosaicPanelInfo`](crate::MosaicPanelInfo) config was already present but
//! never made it into FITS headers — so mosaic panels merged in tools like
//! PixInsight have no way to know which panel a sub belongs to.
//!
//! `FrameContext` is the single bundle that flows from the executor through
//! `expose.rs` into `DeviceOps::save_fits`. Every Option<_> field is honestly
//! optional — if the corresponding device isn't connected or the telemetry
//! isn't available, the keyword is simply omitted from the FITS header rather
//! than written with a sentinel value (silent fallbacks are bugs; an absent
//! keyword is the honest answer).
//!
//! The bridge-side `api_save_fits_file` reads this struct and emits the
//! corresponding FITS keywords. Custom Nightshade-specific keywords use the
//! `NS-*` prefix (NS-MOSNM, NS-PIDX, NS-PROW, NS-PCOL, NS-SESID, NS-FIDX,
//! NS-NPLN) to stay clear of standard astrophotography conventions while
//! still being readable in any FITS viewer.
