//! Meridian Flip Executor — the canonical engine for meridian flips.
//!
//! Both the explicit `MeridianFlip` instruction node and the trigger-driven
//! `RecoveryAction::MeridianFlip` route through this executor — the
//! pre-existing two-implementation split was unifying-required so users got the
//! same timeouts, altitude check, autofocus parameters, settle behaviour,
//! plate-solve handling, pier-side telemetry fallback, abort behaviour, and
//! `mark_flip_performed` semantics regardless of trigger source).
//!
//! Pre-flip rustdoc invariants checked here:
//! - Target altitude is ≥ `MIN_POST_FLIP_ALTITUDE_DEG`.
//! - If a cover/calibrator is configured, the cover is *not* closed
//!   (a covered camera makes plate-solve fail and triggers
//!   `AbortAndPark` unnecessarily).
//! - Mount reports it can flip (the caller is expected to gate on this; the
//!   executor logs warnings but does not refuse if the capability check is
//!   unavailable, since some drivers do not expose it).
