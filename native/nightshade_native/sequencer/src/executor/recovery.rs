//! Wave 4 Recovery Mode — snapshot accessors and runtime-config push for
//! the recovery state machine.
//!
//! The recovery loop itself runs inside the spawned executor task (see
//! the recovery-driver block in `mod.rs::start()`) — this file only
//! holds the small public surface the bridge / UI / tests use to read
//! the live state and push new defaults into the
//! [`crate::recovery::RecoveryRuntimeConfig`] slot.
//!
//! Layout note: the *operator* recovery gestures (`recovery_try_now`,
//! `recovery_abort`) live in `lifecycle.rs` because they are lifecycle
//! commands that drive the loop, not state reads. The clean split is:
//!
//!   * `recovery.rs` (this file): read state + push defaults.
//!   * `lifecycle.rs`           : "Try Now" / "Abort" buttons.
//!   * `mod.rs::start()`        : the actual retry-loop driver task.
