//! Wave 8 Replay Debug — structured decision logging surface on the
//! [`SequenceExecutor`].
//!
//! The executor broadcasts a typed `DecisionEvent` for every scheduler
//! pick, trigger firing, recovery transition, frame verdict, plugin
//! invocation, manual operator action, and lifecycle phase. The bridge
//! layer subscribes via [`SequenceExecutor::subscribe_decisions`] and
//! routes events to two sinks:
//!
//!   1. The unified `NightshadeEvent` stream as
//!      `SequencerEvent::DecisionLogged` (for live UI overlays).
//!   2. The `sequence_decisions` Drift table (for the post-run Replay
//!      screen).
//!
//! This file holds the small accessor / mutator methods that control the
//! sender, the active run-id stamp, and the runtime enable toggle. The
//! actual emit sites are scattered across the executor task, the
//! scheduler, the recovery driver, and the instruction nodes — they call
//! [`SequenceExecutor::emit_decision`] or use a clone of the sender
//! obtained from [`SequenceExecutor::decision_sender`].
//!
//! Not here: the `ManualIntervention` events emitted by operator-driven
//! lifecycle commands live in `lifecycle.rs::emit_manual_intervention` —
//! they're scoped narrowly so the broader `emit_decision` API stays the
//! single entry point for everything else.
