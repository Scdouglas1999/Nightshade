//! Crash-recovery checkpoint surface on the [`SequenceExecutor`].
//!
//! Five-and-a-half methods that wire [`crate::checkpoint::CheckpointManager`]
//! into the executor lifecycle:
//!
//!   * [`SequenceExecutor::set_checkpoint_dir`] — opt the executor into
//!     persistence by giving it a directory.
//!   * [`SequenceExecutor::has_recoverable_checkpoint`] /
//!     [`SequenceExecutor::get_checkpoint_info`] — pre-start UI probes.
//!   * [`SequenceExecutor::load_checkpoint`] /
//!     [`SequenceExecutor::resume_from_checkpoint`] — rehydrate the
//!     executor from the latest on-disk snapshot.
//!   * [`SequenceExecutor::save_checkpoint`] — write the current
//!     in-memory state to disk; called by the streaming-checkpoint
//!     task on every milestone (frame completed, node finished).
//!   * [`SequenceExecutor::clear_checkpoint`] /
//!     [`SequenceExecutor::mark_checkpoint_completed`] — terminal
//!     hygiene.
//!
//! Why these belong together: every method is gated on
//! `self.checkpoint_manager`, treats `None` as "checkpoint feature
//! disabled" (so a CLI run without a checkpoint dir behaves as if the
//! feature did not exist), and routes through the same on-disk format.
//! Splitting them across files would force every caller to learn two
//! file boundaries to read the persistence contract.
//!
//! Audit §1.16 invariant (preserved): the same `Arc<CheckpointManager>`
//! is shared between the executor's public API (these methods) and the
//! streaming-checkpoint task spawned inside `start()`. The
//! `checkpoint_manager_is_arc_shared` test in `mod.rs` enforces this
//! by pointer equality.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here:
//!   * The streaming-checkpoint task itself — that lives inline in
//!     `start()` because it captures dozens of locals from the spawn
//!     site.
//!   * The on-disk format (`SessionCheckpoint`, `CheckpointManager`) —
//!     that lives in [`crate::checkpoint`]. This file is only the
//!     executor-side bridge.
