//! Mid-flight `update_*` configuration mutators on the [`SequenceExecutor`].
//!
//! Audit §1.8 axis: every value the bridge / Dart UI can change WHILE A
//! SEQUENCE IS RUNNING lives here. Each method follows the same
//! contract:
//!
//!   1. Write through `self.runtime_config` (the
//!      [`super::RuntimeConfig`] handle the spawned executor task reads
//!      on every iteration). This is the canonical write — even an
//!      idle executor sees the change on the next `start()`.
//!   2. If a sequence is running (`self.command_tx` is `Some`), forward
//!      the change as the matching `ExecutorCommand` so the live task
//!      picks it up without having to re-read the runtime config slot
//!      itself — important for atomic fields the task caches.
//!   3. Emit `ExecutorEvent::RuntimeConfigUpdated { what: "..." }` so
//!      UI subscribers can invalidate any cached display.
//!
//! The original audit-flagged silent-fallback was an executor that
//! `let _ = (pixels, ...)`-ignored UpdateDitherConfig etc.; this file
//! is what fixed it. The two-step write-then-forward pattern is what
//! makes the fix robust against future "I only need to update one of
//! the two places" mistakes — the runtime config IS the truth, the
//! command channel only exists to wake the task.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here:
//!   * `set_*` pre-start setters — they live in [`super::setup`] because
//!     they mutate executor fields directly without going through the
//!     command channel.
//!   * `update_recovery_config` — lives in [`super::recovery`] because
//!     its value is recovery-specific and recovery is the only
//!     consumer. The cross-axis note in `recovery.rs` documents this.
//!   * `update_trigger_state` — lives in [`super::setup`] because it
//!     mutates the trigger manager state via a closure, not the
//!     runtime config.
//!   * Read-only `current_*` dashboard snapshots that are NOT paired
//!     with an `update_*` push (none currently) — those would belong
//!     wherever they read from. The two `current_*` methods that ARE
//!     here (cloud-motion JSON, adaptive-swap JSON) are paired with
//!     their matching `update_*` because the dashboard reads back what
//!     was pushed; co-locating them keeps the contract obvious.
