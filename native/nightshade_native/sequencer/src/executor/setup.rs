//! Pre-start configuration and wire-up surface on the [`SequenceExecutor`].
//!
//! Everything here is one of two things:
//!
//!   1. A `set_*` setter the bridge / tests call between `new()` and
//!      `start()` to wire device ids, safety policy, save paths, trigger
//!      gating, and the per-run event subscription handle into the
//!      executor. These methods MUST be cheap and non-blocking — the
//!      bridge calls a dozen of them in sequence right before `start()`.
//!   2. The post-run teardown (`reset`) that the bridge calls to flip an
//!      executor back to `Idle` after a sequence finishes, so the next
//!      `start()` begins from a known-empty state.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here:
//!   * `update_*` mid-flight mutators — those live in
//!     [`super::runtime_config`] because they push through the
//!     [`super::RuntimeConfig`] handle AND the command channel; the
//!     setters here only write executor fields.
//!   * Sequence loading (`load_sequence`, `calculate_totals`) — those
//!     live in [`super::loading`] because they build the runtime node
//!     tree and compute its scalar metadata.
//!   * `set_checkpoint_dir` — lives in [`super::checkpoint`] because
//!     it is the entry point for the checkpoint persistence surface,
//!     not a generic device-wiring setter.
//!
//! Visibility note: every method on this file's `impl` is `pub` because
//! the bridge layer is the canonical caller. The struct fields these
//! methods mutate are crate-private; only sibling executor modules can
//! see them (Rust child-module privacy), which is exactly what we want.
