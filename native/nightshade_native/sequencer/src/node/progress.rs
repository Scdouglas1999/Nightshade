//! Structured progress reporting for sequencer nodes.
//!
//! Pre-refactor, instruction nodes hand-formatted strings like
//! `"Filter: foo (50%)"` and the executor's progress callback parsed those
//! strings back into `(instruction, percent, detail)` triples via
//! `split_once` and `rfind('(')`. That was brittle (a parenthesis in a
//! target name would corrupt parsing), lossy (no way to surface RA/Dec
//! mid-slew or HFR mid-AF), and tightly coupled to message shape.
//!
//! The new contract: every instruction populates a `ProgressUpdate` with a
//! typed `ProgressDetail`. The executor's progress callback consumes the
//! structured payload directly — no parsing. The legacy `message: String`
//! field is still populated (auto-derived from the detail via `legacy_message`)
//! so the bridge layer can emit the existing `SequencerEvent::InstructionProgress`
//! payload without an FRB schema change.
