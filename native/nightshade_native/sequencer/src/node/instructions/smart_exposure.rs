//! Wave 3 Agent 2: SmartExposure instruction node.
//!
//! The "one row per filter" automation. The user lists per-filter plans
//! (count, sub-length, gain, offset, binning, dither cadence) and this node
//! handles:
//!
//!   * Filter changes (skipped when the wheel is already on the right filter).
//!   * Optional dither between filter changes.
//!   * Round-robin rotation across filters (RGRGRG …) or per-filter exhaustion
//!     (RRRRRGGG …) depending on [`SmartExposureConfig::rotate_filters`].
//!   * A global `integration_budget_secs` cap that lets the node short-circuit
//!     to Success once a wall-clock-equivalent integration budget is met.
//!   * Per-filter completed-frame checkpointing so a sequence killed
//!     mid-rotation resumes on the right filter at the right frame index.
//!
//! # Why delegate to ExposureInstruction / ChangeFilterInstruction?
//!
//! The brief mandates that SmartExposure does **not** reimplement exposure or
//! filter-change logic. Both have grown well-tested integration accounting,
//! trigger-state updates, HFR baseline propagation, and FITS-save error
//! routing. Re-implementing any of that here would inevitably diverge.
//! Instead, SmartExposure constructs the matching `NodeType` variant per
//! plan row and dispatches through [`InstructionRegistry::build`] just like
//! the executor would for a hand-authored sequence. Each delegated child
//! sees the same `ExecutionContext`, so its progress events, trigger
//! updates, and integration accounting are indistinguishable from the
//! manual `FilterChange → Loop(N) → TakeExposure` chain the user would
//! otherwise have written.
//!
//! # Autofocus on filter change
//!
//! We rely on the existing trigger system: when [`ChangeFilterInstruction`]
//! flips `TriggerState::filter_changed`, the user-configured
//! `TriggerType::FilterChange` with `RecoveryAction::Autofocus` (or the
//! per-filter focus offset machinery) fires. SmartExposure does NOT launch
//! its own autofocus run — that would duplicate the trigger pipeline and
//! desync from the rest of the sequencer.
