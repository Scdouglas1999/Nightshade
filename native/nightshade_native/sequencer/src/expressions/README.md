# Sequencer Variable Interpolation Engine

This module powers `${...}` template interpolation across the sequencer.

## Where templates are honoured

| Surface | Field | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RunScript` | `script_path`, every `arguments[i]` | Interpolated before the child process is spawned. Failures abort the node. |
| `RunScript` | (env vars) | Every catalog variable is exported as `NIGHTSHADE_<UPPER_SNAKE>` to the child process. Missing data → variable simply not set. |
| `Notification` | `title`, `message` | Interpolated before the notification fires. Failures abort the node. |
| `TakeExposure` | `save_to` | Interpolated per-frame; result is a relative or absolute path (directories created on demand). Default template `${target.name}_${filter}_${frame:04}.fits`. |
| All nodes | `name` (display label) | Best-effort interpolation for Run Dashboard / tree labels. Failures fall back to the raw template (non-fatal). |

## Syntax

```
${path}              → resolve "path" using the variable catalog
${path:spec}         → resolve "path" then apply format spec
                       (e.g. ${frame:04}, ${target.alt:.1f})
$${                  → literal "${" (the doubled $ escapes interpolation)
```

Format specs supported:
- `0N` (e.g. `04`) — integer zero-pad to width N.
- `.Nf` (e.g. `.1f`) — fixed-point with N decimal places.

Bare `$` not followed by `{` is a literal `$`. A trailing `${` without `}` is a syntax error.

## Variable catalog

Single source of truth: [`catalog.rs::variable_catalog`](./catalog.rs).
Dart mirror: [`interpolation_catalog.dart`](../../../../../packages/nightshade_core/lib/src/models/sequence/interpolation_catalog.dart).

## Error handling

Per "errors are a feature" policy, unknown variables produce a typed `InterpolationError::UnknownVariable`. There is no silent fallback to empty string anywhere in the engine. Callers (run_script, notification, expose) translate the error into a hard `NodeStatus::Failure` so the user is forced to fix their template rather than discover hours later that frames were saved with `image__0001.fits` filenames.

For the cosmetic display-name path (Run Dashboard labels), interpolation failure logs at `debug!` and falls back to the raw template — a broken label is annoying but never load-bearing.

## Adding a new variable

1. Append a `VariableEntry { name, description, group, example, supports_format }` to `variable_catalog()` in `catalog.rs`.
2. Add the matching arm in `resolve_variable()` in `resolver.rs`.
3. Mirror the entry in `interpolation_catalog.dart` (the Dart picker reads from this list).
4. Run `cargo test --test interpolation_smoke` and `flutter test` to verify.

The unit test `catalog_and_resolver_agree_for_every_entry` will fail if step 2 is missed — it iterates the catalog and asserts every name resolves (or fails with `Unresolvable`, never with `UnknownVariable`).
