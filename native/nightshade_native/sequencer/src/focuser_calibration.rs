//! Measuring a focuser's mechanical backlash instead of asking for it.
//!
//! # What backlash does to a focus sweep
//!
//! A focuser's drive train has a dead band: after reversing direction the
//! motor turns for some number of steps before the drawtube follows. Write the
//! optical position as `a = c + d`, where `c` is the commanded position and
//! `d ∈ [0, b]` is however much of the dead band `b` is currently taken up.
//! A long upward move drives `d` to 0; a long downward move drives it to `b`.
//!
//! So the position that focuses the optics depends on how the focuser arrived:
//! arriving upward, focus is commanded at `A` (the true optical focus);
//! arriving downward, it is commanded at `A - b`. That difference IS the
//! backlash, and it is what this module measures:
//!
//! ```text
//! backlash = optimum_measured_approaching_from_below
//!          - optimum_measured_approaching_from_above
//! ```
//!
//! Measured on the owner's ZWO EAF on 2026-09-14 near position 6600: 6620
//! from below, 6515 from above, so 105 steps. An earlier measurement lower in
//! the travel (2026-09-08, near 2500) gave ~83, so backlash is a function of
//! where in the travel it is measured — every record here therefore carries
//! the position and temperature it was taken at, and nothing presents the
//! figure as exact everywhere.
//!
//! # What the scan's run-up actually buys, and when it is not enough
//!
//! Each point is approached deliberately, running `k` steps past the target
//! and back. It is tempting to reason about that one approach in isolation and
//! conclude that `k` must exceed `b`. It does not, because the scan is
//! monotone. Take the from-below pass, whose points ascend by `step`: the move
//! to `p - k` is only `k - step` BELOW the previous sample, so it adds
//! `k - step` to `d`, and the move up to `p` then takes `k` off it. Per point,
//! net, `d` falls by `step` — except on the first point, where `d` can be as
//! high as `b` and the cap means the up-move leaves `max(b - k, 0)`. The
//! from-above pass is the mirror image, filling `d` instead of draining it.
//!
//! So the reversal the scan has accumulated by its nth point is
//!
//! ```text
//! reversal budget(n) = k + (n - 1) * step
//! ```
//!
//! and what matters is whether that reaches `b` before the scan reaches the
//! points that set the vertex. Given a budget comfortably above `b`, the
//! from-below pass sits at `d = 0` and the from-above pass saturates at
//! `d = b`, so the fits recover exactly `b` — for any `k`, which is why `k`
//! alone is not the test. Given a budget short of `b`, the from-above pass is
//! still filling the dead band while it samples, and the measurement
//! UNDER-reports.
//!
//! Under-reporting cannot be detected from a single run: it produces a
//! SMALLER number and nothing in the data says how much smaller. So there are
//! two bounds rather than one correction. Above `reversal_budget(points)` a
//! figure is refused, because nothing in the scan could have taken up a dead
//! band that wide. Above `reversal_budget(points / 2)` — the reversal in hand
//! by the middle of the scan, where the vertex is set — it is reported at low
//! confidence as possibly a floor rather than the value.
//!
//! All of this was established by simulating a gear train of known width
//! against the real routine (`instructions::tests::focuser_backlash`). An
//! earlier version of this module reasoned from the isolated single approach,
//! concluded the rule was `k >= b`, and would have refused a perfectly good
//! measurement of the owner's 105 steps taken with a 40-step run-up — which
//! the simulation recovers as 102 at R² 0.995.
//!
//! One thing the model rules out entirely: a NEGATIVE difference. `d` is
//! confined to `[0, b]`, so the from-below optimum can never sit below the
//! from-above one. A meaningfully negative result is therefore not a backlash
//! at all — it says the two scans were not measuring the same focus, which is
//! what focus drifting during the run, or a focuser not following its
//! commands, looks like.
