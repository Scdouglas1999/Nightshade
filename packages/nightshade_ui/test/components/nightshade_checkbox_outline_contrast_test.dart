/// is an outline and nothing else, so if that outline disappears into the
/// surface the control is not "subtle", it is absent — the label reads as a
/// caption and the operator cannot tell an option they turned off from one that
/// was never offered. WCAG 1.4.11 puts the floor for a UI component's boundary
/// at 3:1, and it is measured here against the real painted decoration rather
/// than asserted about a token, because the widget chooses which token to paint.
///
/// Measured before the repair, on the `border` token every palette handed this
/// widget: red night 1.03:1 on `surfaceElevated` (the delivery destination
/// editor's dialog surface — the unchecked "Stage exports" box rendered as a
/// label with nothing beside it), and dark 1.17:1 on the same level. `border`
/// is the palette's DIVIDER weight; it is the correct colour for a card edge
/// and much too quiet for a control.
