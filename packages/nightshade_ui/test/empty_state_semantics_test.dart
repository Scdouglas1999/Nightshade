/// the button's tap and role landed on the same node as all the words and the
/// screen reached AT-SPI as a single control named for its own prose. Measured
/// on the running Darkroom: its "Nothing to open" state was ONE ~300-character
/// button covering the whole screen, with no node named "Back to session
/// review" for an exact-name lookup to find. States with two or more actions
/// escaped it only because two taps cannot merge into one node, which is why
/// the same screen's start offer read correctly.
