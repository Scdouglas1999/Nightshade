// Regression test for the guide graph's Y-axis labels.
//
// The phone guiding layout leaves the plot area very short (panel header +
// scale-selector row + gutters take a fixed slice of the graph pane), and the
// painter used to draw all five labels — +2" / +1.0" / 0 / -1.0" / -2" —
// unconditionally, so they landed on top of each other as an illegible smear
// at the left edge.
//
// The painter's own text drawing is invisible to the widget tree, so this
// captures the `drawParagraph` calls the painter makes and asserts the label
// rects never overlap.
