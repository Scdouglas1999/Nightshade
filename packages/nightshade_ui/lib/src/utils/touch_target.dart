/// opposite requirements: Android's accessibility rule wants every tappable
/// control to be at least [NightshadeTokens.minTouchTarget] on both edges,
/// while the desktop layouts are deliberately dense — a sequencer tree row
/// carries three action chips, and growing them to 48dp re-flows the whole
/// panel for a pointer that has none of the imprecision the rule exists to
/// absorb.
///
/// Every control that needs both behaviours was writing its own
/// `switch (Theme.of(context).platform)`, four at last count, each subtly
/// different. This is that switch, once.
///
/// A note on which knob to reach for: Material's [IconButton] sizes its hit
/// area from `kMinInteractiveDimension` *plus* [VisualDensity.baseSizeAdjustment
/// ], so an `IconButton` carrying `VisualDensity.compact` has a 40dp hit area
/// no matter what `constraints` it is given — `constraints` bound the visual
/// button, not the tap target. Use [visualDensity] there; [constraints] alone
/// will look like it worked and measure 40x40.
