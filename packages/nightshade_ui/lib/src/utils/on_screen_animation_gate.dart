/// Keeps a repeating [AnimationController] from running while nothing is
/// actually on screen to show for it.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// A repeating `AnimationController` re-schedules a frame on every vsync for as
/// long as it runs. One of them, anywhere in the tree, is enough to stop the
/// whole application from ever idling: the engine produces frames continuously,
/// every screen renders at a degraded framerate, and the machine never gets to
/// rest. It costs the same whether the animation is visible or not.
///
/// That made an unconditional `_controller.repeat()` in `initState` a trap. It
/// looks local and harmless, but it is only correct while the widget is both
/// mounted *and* on screen — and nothing enforces that. Nightshade shipped
/// exactly this bug: a shell-mounted overlay pulsed an icon it only ever draws
/// during an autofocus run, so from launch to quit the app produced ~45 frames
/// per second with a 2%-busy GPU and nothing to draw.
///
/// [TickerMode] already covers the case where a whole route or subtree is
/// deactivated — [SingleTickerProviderStateMixin] mutes its ticker, and a muted
/// ticker stops scheduling. What it does *not* cover is a widget that is mounted
/// and nominally "enabled" but is not being drawn: an [Offstage] child, the
/// unselected branch of an [IndexedStack], or a widget whose own build returns
/// nothing to paint.
///
/// This gate closes that gap by tying the animation to the only thing that
/// actually matters — whether the subtree gets painted. If the controller ticks
/// without the child painting, the animation is invisible, so it is stopped. The
/// moment the child paints again, it resumes. Callers get correct default
/// behaviour without having to remember anything.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// Own the controller as usual, but never call `repeat()` yourself. Wrap the
/// animated subtree and declare *whether* the animation is wanted; the gate
/// decides when it may actually run.
///
/// ```dart
/// OnScreenAnimationGate(
///   controller: _controller,
///   repeating: widget.isLoading,
///   child: AnimatedBuilder(
///     animation: _controller,
///     builder: (context, _) => ...,
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The gate only ever stops an animation it started itself, so a controller that
/// is also driven directly (a one-shot `forward()`, say) is left alone.
