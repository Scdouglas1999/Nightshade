/// mDNS / Bonjour / DNS-SD advertisement for a Nightshade headless server.
///
/// The UDP-broadcast beacon in `discovery.dart` is the legacy zero-conf channel
/// and is still emitted. mDNS is additive — it works on modern Wi-Fi APs where
/// client-to-client broadcast is blocked (most enterprise / Eero / mesh setups)
/// and on Tailscale / VPN segments where there's no broadcast domain at all.
///
/// The service is registered as `_nightshade._tcp` so the existing client-side
/// `discoverViaMdns` (which already calls `startDiscovery('_nightshade._tcp')`)
/// finds us without any extra wiring.
///
/// ### TXT record contract
///
/// The advertisement carries these keys so a mobile client can decide whether
/// to connect, which protocol to use, and which fingerprint to confirm against
/// the QR — all without an extra HTTP roundtrip:
///
/// - `version`           — server app version (e.g. `2.5.0`)
/// - `scheme`            — `http` or `https`; tells the client whether the
///                         server was started with `--tls` so the mDNS-only
///                         flow (no QR) still hits the right transport
/// - `fingerprint`       — same SHA-256 the server returns from `GET /api/info`
///                         (TLS-SPKI when TLS is active, token-derived
///                         otherwise). Lets a QR-paired client cross-check
///                         the discovered host before sending its bearer.
/// - `pairingSupported`  — `true` / `false`; gates whether the unpaired-client
///                         UX shows the "Pair this server" CTA
/// - `name`              — human-readable display name shown next to the host
///                         in the server picker. Duplicated in the Service
///                         `name` field for platforms that show it in the OS
///                         picker (iOS, macOS).
///
/// ### Failure model
///
/// `start()` is best-effort. If `nsd.register(...)` throws (no entitlement on
/// iOS, Avahi daemon not running on a stripped-down Linux box, Bonjour service
/// missing on a fresh Windows install), the registration is silently disabled
/// for this run after a warning callback to the caller's logger. The HTTP
/// server continues — UDP broadcast and manual entry remain available. This
/// matches the audit's "log a warning and continue, not fail to start" rule
/// for ancillary background services.
