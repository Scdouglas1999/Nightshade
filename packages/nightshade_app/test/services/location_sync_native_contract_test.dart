// The Rust backend has no coordinate that means "no site".
//
// Its observer location is `Option<ObserverLocation>`; `None` is the only way
// to say the user never chose one, and every native consumer reads a `Some` as
// a site the user picked. The sync provider nevertheless pushed the settings
// triple unconditionally, so a fresh install — which seeds 0/0/0 before the
// user is asked anything — told the backend the operator observes from the
// Gulf of Guinea. Live, on the release bundle: the simulated mount then
// reported a parked altitude of −78.2° and the Dashboard's Equipment panel
// printed it, beside a status bar that honestly said `LST --:--`.
//
// The backend must get null until there is a site, and the site once there is.
