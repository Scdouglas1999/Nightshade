// Thumbnail cells must decode at the size they display.

// The tree carried not one `cacheWidth`, `cacheHeight` or `ResizeImage`, so
// every thumbnail surface decoded its image at full encoded resolution and
// parked that decode in `PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache`: a 512 px frame
// thumbnail in a 72 px cell is 1 MB of RGBA for 20 KB of visible pixels, and a
// full-frame master preview PNG in the same cell is 65 MB. Against the cache's
// 100 MB default budget a night's rail evicts and re-decodes itself forever,
// and on the desktop every re-decode was a fresh blocking FITS read.
