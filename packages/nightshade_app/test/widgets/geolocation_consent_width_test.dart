// The geolocation consent dialog must read like the rest of the app's dialogs.
//
// Found live (coverage closeout, never-claimed cluster B): on the 1600 px
// desktop window the dialog rendered ~1520 px wide — its body was one unbroken
// line of text running the full width of the app, because the AlertDialog had
// no width constraint at all. Every other dialog on the same screen
// (SequenceIssuesDialog, the unwritable-capture-folder confirm) is bounded by
// AdaptiveDialogConstraints at the 480 px design width.
//
// This is the consent gate for the app's only outbound request that carries
// the operator's public IP address, so it is exactly the dialog that has to
// look deliberate and be easy to read.
