// The consent dialog must name exactly what each allowed tier sends.
//
// The failure this pins is silent by construction: a tier whose disclosure is
// missing still runs, and the operator has agreed to something they were never
// told about. Nightshade is routinely installed on isolated observatory
// networks, where the names of the networks around the house leaving the
// machine is a bigger deal than the position that comes back.
//
// The body is built by a pure function so the copy can be asserted per tier
// without pumping a dialog for each combination.
