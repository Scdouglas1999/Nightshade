//
// The panel is 320px wide including its 44px icon strip, which leaves 244 for
// the content and 216 inside a section card. The old layout put two
// fixed-width buttons per row inside a card of its own inside a 24px inset:
// 80px of the panel went to padding and every label was ellipsised — "U…" for
// Unpark, "St…" for Start tracking, "Three-Point P…", "RA (H…", "Sl…", "S…".
// A Row of Expanded children is a perfectly valid layout, so nothing failed
// and nothing logged; the only thing that noticed was the operator.
