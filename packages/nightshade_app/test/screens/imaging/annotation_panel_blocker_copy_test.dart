// Observed on the running desktop build after 12 successful captures with no
// plate solver installed:
//
//   * the objects list read "No image annotated / Capture an image to see
//     detected objects" — an instruction to redo something already done a
//     dozen times, while the status card two rows above said "No plate solver
//     installed";
//   * that status card's own second line was hard-clipped flat at the panel
//     edge mid-word ("...in Settings to label ob") with no ellipsis, because
//     its text column was laid out at its unconstrained intrinsic width.
