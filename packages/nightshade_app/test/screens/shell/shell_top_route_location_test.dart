// What the shell reads to decide which rail row is lit.
//
// The rail is a statement about where the operator is, so the location it is
// handed has to be the route on top of the navigator. A `context.push` of a
// route that lives inside the ShellRoute — which is how every Darkroom and
// session-review entry point navigates — folds its match into the existing
// shell match, so the top-level match list still ends with the shell and the
// shell's own `matchedLocation` is the rail route the push started from.
