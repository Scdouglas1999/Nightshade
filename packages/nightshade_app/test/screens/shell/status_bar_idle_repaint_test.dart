/// What this pins, and why it is worth a test at all.
///
/// Measured on an idle release build with `NIGHTSHADE_FRAME_TIMING=1`, the
/// clock's per-second `setState` was the ONLY thing making the app produce
/// frames — a steady 1.0 fps with nothing on screen changing but the seconds:
///
/// ```text
/// [frame-timing] window=5.0s frames=6 fps=1.2 buildAvgMs=0.1 rasterAvgMs=229.3
/// [frame-timing] window=5.0s frames=4 fps=0.8 buildAvgMs=0.1 rasterAvgMs=231.9
/// ```
///
/// The tick lived on `_StatusBarState`, so each of those frames rebuilt the
/// whole bar — every device pill, both action buttons, the enclosing
/// `LayoutBuilder` — to move one digit, and repainted the parent layer with it.
/// Moving the tick into the clock chip and giving that chip a `RepaintBoundary`
/// is invisible on screen, which is exactly why it needs pinning: nothing about
/// the rendered bar would tell you it had regressed.
