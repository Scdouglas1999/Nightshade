// Two chips in the shell status bar watched values that move far faster than
// anything they render, and the bar is on screen on every route.
//
// `localSiderealTimeProvider` is a `double` recomputed off a 1 Hz wall clock;
// the chip renders it as `HH:mm`. Watching the provider whole rebuilt the chip
// sixty times for every change an operator can see. The run pill had the same
// shape: while a sequence is running the executor republishes progress every
// second (`_startPerRunTimers`), and most of what moves in it — elapsed
// seconds, the smoothed ETA — is not on the pill.
//
// A rebuild that renders identical pixels is not free on this platform.
// Flutter's Linux GTK embedder ships with no damage-region support
// (`nm -D libflutter_linux_gtk.so | grep -c damage` → 0), so ANY dirty frame
// repaints the entire window. Measured on the profile bundle over the VM
// service, the LST chip alone was one full-window repaint per second, forever,
// on every screen.
//
// These tests pin the rule both chips now follow: watch what is DISPLAYED, so
// that a rebuild MEANS the rendered text moved. They drive the providers with
// zero-duration pumps, never `pump(Duration)`, so the bar's own one-second
// wall-clock tick can never fire inside the window being asserted on and
// confound the result.
