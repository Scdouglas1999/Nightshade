// AAVSO chip and the MPC chip did nothing at all (a disabled chip has onTap
// null) and no explanation for either ever appeared. The app had already
// computed both reasons — "MPC astrometry is for moving objects..." and the
// AAVSO one — and rendered them only for `_format`, which the user could not
// move onto a disabled network. The text was written and unreachable.
