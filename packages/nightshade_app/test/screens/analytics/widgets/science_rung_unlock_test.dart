// A locked rung has to offer the thing it asks for.
//
// Observed: rung 3's sheet said "Track a star ... to start collecting points"
// and rung 5's said to record photometry before exporting, and each offered
// only Close and "Got it". Neither carried a control that did the named thing,
// so the guided on-ramp ended by telling the user to go find the control
// themselves.
//
// Second pass: the unlock button existed but fired `onJumpToPhotometry`, which
// on the Science tab's populated branch merely scrolls to the PHOTOMETRY
// section — charts and export buttons. That section cannot pick a star (rung
// 2's CTA was moved off it for that exact reason), so a locked "Build a light
// curve" rung sent the operator to an empty Differential Photometry card: the
// dead end relocated, not removed. The unlock has to go to the Science HUD,
// where the star is chosen and the points accumulate.
