// The frame-quality badge (GOOD / NEEDS REVIEW / POOR) must paint ON TOP of the
// thumbnail.
//
// Observed defect: the badge was the FIRST child of the tile's Stack, so every
// thumbnail that actually loaded (Image.memory, BoxFit.cover, infinite
// width/height) painted over it. The chip was therefore visible only on frames
// whose image FAILED to load — the summary said "Needs Review: 18" and the user
// could not see which 18. Stack children paint in list order, so this test pins
// the badge's position after the thumbnail.
