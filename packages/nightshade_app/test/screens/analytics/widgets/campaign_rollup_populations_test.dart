// The Campaign Rollup card must not describe three populations with one set

// Observed defect (M13, one session, two 300s lights both rejected in the
// grader): the card showed "Total integration 0.0h" (accepted light frames)
// beside a session row reading "0.17h integration" (the session's own total),
// and "Per-filter progress: No frames captured for this target yet." — flatly
// false — while "Effective imaging 0.0%" was printed for a campaign whose only
// session had never closed, i.e. had nothing to measure.
