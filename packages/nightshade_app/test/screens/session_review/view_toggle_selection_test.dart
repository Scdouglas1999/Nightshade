// On Session Review the SELECTED tab must not read as the dim one, and the
// tab strip must say which view is live to assistive tech as well as in pixels.
//
// This used to guard a pair of pill chips under the header. The Observatory
// overhaul (05 §4) allows ONE tab style — the underline strip in the page
// header — so the pills are gone and the assertions moved onto `AdaptiveTabBar`.
// The DEFECTS the old test pinned are still the ones worth pinning:
//
//  * the app theme's `hoverColor` is opaque, and the pointer rests on whichever
//    tab was just clicked, so a selection painted as a FILL was repainted grey
//    by its own hover and the open tab looked disabled. The underline style has
//    no fill to erase, and the selected label must stay `textPrimary` with the
//    pointer parked on it;
//  * a tab that exposes no selected state leaves neither the pixels nor the
//    tree saying which view is live.
