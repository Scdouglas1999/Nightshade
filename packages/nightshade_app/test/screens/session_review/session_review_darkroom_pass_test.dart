// A Darkroom pass that ended badly has to be visible on the session it ran on.
//
// The dawn pass runs while nobody is at the machine, so its ending lives only
// on its `darkroom_jobs` row: the toast that reports a pass belongs to the
// button that started one, and nothing started this one. A pass that failed at
// 05:40 therefore left Session Review showing the night's verdict, the masters
// and a clean-night score with no sign that the drafting, the night report and
// the delivery for it had not happened — the operator's first clue was a
// destination that never received the night.
//
// What these pin: a failed pass and a stopped pass are stated on the session
// they belong to, with the row's own sentence — and so is a pass that ran to
// the END, because on the desktop nothing else states one. Measured on a
// completed D1 night (one `done` job, four autopilot recipes, four rendered
// drafts, nine delivered files): the Dashboard, the status bar and this screen
// mentioned none of it, and the morning notification's deep link is routed by
// the phone alone. The only way to those drafts was an unlabelled icon in an
// Analytics session dialog.
