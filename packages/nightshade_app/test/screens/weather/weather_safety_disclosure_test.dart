// The Weather screen must not claim the sky is being watched when it is not.
//
// Audit 2026-07-29: with "Enable weather safety" OFF the screen showed a green
// shield, "Safety Status — Conditions safe for imaging", and a Current Settings
// panel reading "Auto-Park: Enabled" — pixel-identical to the monitoring-on
// state. The provider reports `safe` when nothing was evaluated (there is no
// verdict to act on), so the copy has to be derived from the monitoring/armed
// flags instead of from the status alone.
//
// These test the copy decisions directly. The flags they consume are covered by
// nightshade_core/test/providers/weather_safety_monitoring_disclosure_test.dart;
// together the two cover settings -> flags -> rendered words. A full
// WeatherScreen pump is deliberately NOT used: that screen owns a live map
// (network tiles) and a 5-minute evaluation timer, which makes it slow and
// flaky for what is a pure text decision.
