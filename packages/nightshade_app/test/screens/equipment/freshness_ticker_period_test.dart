// The "Last checked … ago" age label must tick FASTER than the poll whose age
// it reports.
//
// "Advance the label at the same cadence the reading can change" is the trap:
// a ticker of `Duration(seconds: 5)` — the same period as
// `DeviceService.environmentPollInterval` — samples an age at exactly the period
// of the thing being aged, which yields a CONSTANT, the fixed phase offset
// between the two timers rather than elapsed time. Both timers start from the
// same event (connect calls `_ensureEnvironmentPolling()`; the card's
// `initState` starts the ticker milliseconds later), so the offset is ~0 and the
// label reads "0s ago" permanently, changing only when the card re-mounts at a
// different tick phase.
//
// This asserts the RELATIONSHIP, not the literal 1 s, because the relationship
// is what matters: any edit that sets the ticker back to the poll period (or
// slower) reintroduces the defect and fails here. A widget test cannot
// substitute: the ticker samples the real `DateTime.now()`, so `tester.pump`
// advances Flutter's fake timer clock without moving the value being
// displayed.
