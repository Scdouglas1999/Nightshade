/// The Equipment screen's right-hand STATUS rail was measured burning ~10x the
/// CPU of any other screen while completely idle with zero devices connected:
/// 231-251% with the rail expanded versus 22-23% with it collapsed, flipped
/// deterministically by the rail's own toggle across five samples, on a static
/// "No devices connected" empty state with nothing animating on screen.
///
/// An idle panel must schedule no frames. These tests pin that: they mount the
/// rail's two panels and assert the frame loop goes quiet, so a future change
/// that reintroduces a perpetual animation (or a provider that hands back a new
/// object identity on every read and drives an unbounded rebuild loop) fails
/// here instead of on a battery in the field.
