// Equipment-screen connect failures route through the guided connection
// troubleshooter.
//
// When a device the user picked in the discovery panel fails to connect, the
// bare "Failed to connect: $e" snackbar is replaced by
// [ConnectionTroubleshooterDialog], which turns the raw driver string into a
// plain-language, hardware-aware remediation playbook while preserving that
// string verbatim in its collapsible "Technical details" section.
//
// Two layers of coverage:
//   1. `DiscoveryPanel.showConnectionTroubleshooter` (the @visibleForTesting
//      orchestration seam): the correct driver type / raw error are derived
//      from the backend the user actually tried, the dialog is shown with the
//      friendly headline for the driver/usb category, and pressing
//      "Retry connection" resolves the future to `true`.
//   2. The end-to-end connect path through the real [DiscoveryPanel], which
//      delegates to the shared [DeviceConnectionMixin.connectDevice]: a failing
//      `connectCamera` opens the troubleshooter, and pressing "Retry
//      connection" drives exactly one more (bounded) connect attempt. The
//      mixin's single-retry contract means the second failure falls back to the
//      bare snackbar rather than re-opening the dialog — bounded by
//      construction, no unbounded recursion.
