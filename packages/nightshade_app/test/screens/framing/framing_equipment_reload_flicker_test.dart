// Regression test: the Framing sidebar's Equipment card must keep showing the
// equipment it has already resolved while its provider re-runs.
//
// Observed on the running desktop build: on arrival at Framing the Equipment
// section rendered nothing but a CircularProgressIndicator, and it was still
// spinning minutes later — while the FOV / Resolution / Sensor rows directly
// below it were populated the whole time. Sampling the card region ten times
// over ~30 s found a bare spinner in eight of them and the resolved
// "My First Rig / Simulated Camera / 530mm f/5.0" in two.
//
// Both halves are fed by the SAME framingFOVProvider. The rows below read
// `equipmentAsync.valueOrNull` and keep the retained value; the card used
// `.when(...)` whose `skipLoadingOnReload` defaults to FALSE, so it threw the
// resolved value away and painted a spinner every time the provider re-ran.
// And framingFOVProvider watches cameraStateProvider, so ordinary camera
// telemetry (cooler power, sensor temperature, exposure progress) re-runs its
// async getCameraStatus round-trip continuously.
