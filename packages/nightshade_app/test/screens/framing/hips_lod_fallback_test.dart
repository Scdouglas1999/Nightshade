// Component C10 — level-of-detail "never blank" guard for the Flutter-side GPU
// HiPS framing tile layer, driven through the real C6 loader fed the committed
// C-FIX fixtures.
//
// THE CONTRACT THIS PINS (anti-jank requirement #4, LOD never-blank fallback):
// when the view changes to a region whose SHARP (selected-Norder) tiles have not
// streamed in yet, the layer must show an already-loaded coarser tile (a parent
// ancestor) or the whole-sky Allsky base UNDER the streaming sharp layer — never
// a blank flash. Only once the sharp tile lands is it promoted to the primary
// layer on top.
//
// HOW IT PROVES IT, deterministically:
//   1. Pre-seed the loader's cache with the committed COARSE fixtures (the
//      Norder5 parents + Norder4 grandparents) so a coarser ancestor is resident
//      for the M31 field — exactly the state after an earlier coarse pass.
//   2. HOLD the sharp Norder6 primary fetches in flight (they cannot resolve).
//   3. Request the fixture viewport and fire the debounce. Assert the published
//      snapshot has imagery (Allsky + coarse fallback tiles) and that the C8
//      painter therefore draws SOMETHING (>=1 GPU mesh) — the region is covered,
//      not blank — even though zero sharp primaries are resident yet.
//   4. Release the held sharp fetches; assert they are promoted to primaryTiles
//      and the snapshot version advanced (the sharp layer arrived on top).
//
// This is the single most important smoothness guarantee: a user panning/zooming
// always sees coarse imagery immediately and the sharp tiles sharpen in, with no
// black gap at any moment.
