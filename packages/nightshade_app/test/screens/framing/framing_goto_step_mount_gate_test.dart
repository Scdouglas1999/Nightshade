// Guided Framing step 4 ("GoTo & Frame") must not claim to be Ready when the
// mount is disconnected.
//
// [SlewDropdownButton] gates itself on `mountState.connectionState ==
// connected`, but this step's badge was driven by `hasTarget` alone. With the
// mount disconnected the step therefore showed a GREEN "Ready" pill over a
// button that swallowed every click in silence — no toast, no dialog, no log
// line — so the operator had no way to learn why nothing happened.
//
// Pinned here: the badge tracks the button's own enabling predicate, and the
// disabled state explains itself in words.
