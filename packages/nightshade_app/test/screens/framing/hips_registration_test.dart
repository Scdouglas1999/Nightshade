// Component C10 — app-level registration guard for the Flutter-side GPU HiPS
// framing tile layer, fed the committed real DSS2-colour C-FIX fixtures.
//
// THE CONTRACT THIS PINS (anti-jank requirement #7, "Registration"):
// the HiPS tile mosaic the C8 painter composites and the FOV/mosaic overlay the
// framing canvas draws must register to the SAME pixel at every zoom. Both
// project sky degrees through the one shared [FramingPlateScale] /
// [FramingSkyProjection]; if the tile layer ever drifted onto its own geometry
// the imagery would slide out from under the reticle as the user zoomed, which
// is the single most visible failure mode of a tiled survey background.
//
// HOW IT PROVES IT (without re-deriving the projection formula in the test):
//   1. We build the production C3 visible-tile set for the M31 fixture field
//      through `HipsTileSelection.computeVisibleTiles` — the EXACT call the C6
//      loader makes — so the meshes the C8 painter would draw are the real ones.
//   2. We replay the real C8 [HipsTileLayerPainter] (fed those meshes, with the
//      fixtures decoded through the production `ui.decodeImageFromList` path)
//      into a recording canvas that captures the screen positions of the
//      `drawVertices` triangle meshes it actually emits.
//   3. We independently build the FOV-overlay projection
//      ([FramingSkyProjection], what the framing reticle/mosaic overlay
//      registers against) from the identical plate scale / target / zoom / pan /
//      rotation, pick a known sky point (the fixture field centre and several
//      tile corners), and assert that point's overlay-projected screen position
//      co-locates with the SAME sky point as carried in the painter's emitted
//      mesh — to within 0.5 logical px — at zoom {0.5, 1, 2, 4}.
//
// If the tile layer and the overlay ever computed different screen positions for
// one sky point at any of those zooms, the co-location assertion fails — the
// tiles would be de-registered from the FOV reticle and this catches it.
//
// Determinism: no network, no asset bundle. The fixture JPEG bytes are read off
// disk via the C-FIX descriptor and decoded through the production
// `ui.decodeImageFromList` path under `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding`.
