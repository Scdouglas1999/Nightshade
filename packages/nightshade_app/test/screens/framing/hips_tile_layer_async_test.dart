// Component C10 — async-non-blocking + GPU-only op-stream guard for the
// Flutter-side GPU HiPS framing tile layer, driven end-to-end through the real
// C6 loader fed the committed C-FIX fixtures.
//
// THE CONTRACT THIS PINS (anti-jank requirements #1, #3, #6):
//
//   #1  Fetch + decode never block the UI/build thread. The C8 painter is a pure
//       function of a pre-built immutable snapshot: it `await`s nothing, opens no
//       socket, decodes no image. We prove this by running the real C6 loader
//       (which performs all fetch/decode work) on a ManualLoaderClock + a
//       fixture-backed fetcher, draining the loader's async work, THEN painting —
//       and asserting paint() is synchronous (returns a value, never a Future)
//       and emits the resident tiles without touching the loader.
//
//   #3  Debounce + dedup + cancel. A burst of viewport requests collapses to ONE
//       recompute (the trailing debounce), and a tile is fetched at most once
//       across that burst (dedup). We assert both against the loader's behaviour
//       and the fixture fetcher's per-tile call counts.
//
//   #6  GPU compositing only. Every pixel the painter moves goes through
//       `Canvas.drawVertices` (textured triangles on the GPU); it issues zero
//       `drawImageRect` / `drawImage` / `drawRawAtlas`-free CPU pixel ops. A
//       recording canvas captures the op stream and asserts it is drawVertices
//       (+ the clip/save/restore framing), nothing else.
//
// Determinism: the loader's debounce runs on a ManualLoaderClock (no wall-clock),
// fetches are served from committed bytes (no network), and decode goes through
// the production `ui.decodeImageFromList` path.
