// The framing canvas's top chrome must never cover its own interactive chips.
//
// THE BUG: the on-canvas toolbar sat at `top: 16` inside a [Wrap] that flows onto
// a second line at narrow widths, while the floating target card and the
// equipment-status hint were each pinned at a literal `top: 60`. Below roughly
// 1100 px wide the wrapped second row landed exactly under those cards — and
// because the cards were LATER children of the same [Stack], they painted over
// it and absorbed its hits. The "HiPS Tiles" chip was visible ghosting through
// the target card and could not be clicked at all.
//
// These tests pin geometry, not pixels: the toolbar's bottom edge must be above
// the cards' top edge, and the chip must be the widget that actually receives a
// tap at its own centre.
