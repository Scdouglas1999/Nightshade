// Component C10 — seam-free mosaicing guard for the Flutter-side GPU HiPS
// framing tile layer, over the committed C-FIX primary tile set.
//
// THE CONTRACT THIS PINS (anti-jank requirement #5, seam-free mosaicing):
// neighbouring HEALPix tiles must share byte-identical boundary sky points, so
// when each is projected to the canvas their touching edges coincide to the
// pixel and the mosaic has NO gaps / black slivers between tiles at any zoom.
//
// HOW IT PROVES IT, without trusting a single code path twice:
//   1. Build the production C3 visible-tile meshes for the M31 fixture field.
//   2. For every pair of tiles that are HEALPix neighbours (their NESTED indices
//      address adjacent diamonds), find the boundary they share and assert the
//      mesh vertices along that shared boundary co-locate on screen — to the
//      pixel — between the two tiles. Coinciding projected edges == seam-free.
//   3. Independently, assert each tile's projected footprint (its mesh screen
//      bounds) overlaps or abuts its neighbour with no gap wider than a sub-pixel
//      tolerance, at multiple zooms, so a regression that left a gutter is caught
//      visually as well as per-vertex.
//
// The fixture's committed primary set (the full gap-free Norder6 mosaic footprint
// over M31) is the realistic, dense neighbour graph this needs.
