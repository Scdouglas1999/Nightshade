// Registration / regression guard for the survey-backed framing canvas.
//
// THE BUG THIS GUARDS: the equipment FOV reticle must be drawn at the *same*
// astrometric plate scale as the survey background image. Divergent scales — a
// fit-to-canvas survey draw rect, a hardcoded `60px/deg` FOV reticle, a third
// gesture mapping — make the rectangle a user draws over a patch of sky
// correspond to different pixels than the survey imagery occupies there. One
// `FramingPlateScale` is the single answer; this test proves the wired-up screen
// threads that survey-registered scale into BOTH the background painter and the
// FOV reticle, so they stay co-registered to the pixel.
//
// Concretely, with a known survey cutout (2.0deg wide, 800x600px) and a
// known equipment FOV, pumped at a fixed surface size, we assert:
//
//   1. The FOV reticle painter and the survey background painter both
//      receive the *exact same* `FramingPlateScale` the framing provider
//      published for the loaded image — not a synthetic fallback and not a
//      hardcoded 60px/deg. A regression that re-introduced a divergent
//      scale would make these two `plateScale` values differ.
//   2. The on-screen FOV rectangle width (what the painter actually draws)
//      equals `fovWidthDeg * plateScale.pixelsPerDegree(canvasSize, zoom)`
//      within 1 logical pixel, where `canvasSize` is the *measured*,
//      sidebar-excluded canvas region. This proves the reticle is sized
//      from the background scale and confirms C6's LayoutBuilder feeds the
//      bounded canvas box (not the whole-window MediaQuery size that
//      includes the sidebar).
//   3. With rotation=30deg, the survey background painter receives
//      rotation=30 — i.e. the field rotation reaches the background, so the
//      imagery rotates together with the (identically rotated) FOV overlay.
//
// Determinism: there is no network. We override `framingProvider` with a
// notifier seeded with a pre-decoded in-memory `ui.Image` and a known
// `FramingPlateScale`, and override `framingFOVProvider` with a ready
// equipment result. `settle: false` + fixed-step pumps avoid the framing
// screen's `ContextualTourPrompt` fade animation tripping pumpAndSettle.
