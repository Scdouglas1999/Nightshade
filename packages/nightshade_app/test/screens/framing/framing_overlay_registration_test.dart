// Co-registration regression guard for the framing canvas under simultaneous
// pan AND rotation (components C5/C6).
//
// THE BUG THIS GUARDS:
// The survey background painter composes its transform as
//   rotate(canvasCenter) ∘ translate(pan)
// (it draws the image into a pan-displaced draw rect and THEN rotates the whole
// canvas about the canvas center). The FOV / equipment / mosaic OVERLAYS are
// built from nested `Transform` widgets, and those must compose the SAME way —
// rotate about the canvas center OUTERMOST, translate by pan INNERMOST — or the
// reticle slides off the imagery by `rotate(pan) - pan` whenever rotation != 0
// and pan != 0.
//
// A pure widget golden would be brittle and platform-dependent for this; the
// invariant under test is purely the transform composition order, so this test
// reconstructs BOTH transforms exactly as production builds them (the painter's
// canvas ops and the overlay's Transform widgets) and asserts that a point
// anchored at the canvas center maps to the SAME screen pixel through each.
//
// If someone reverts the overlay back to translate-outer / rotate-inner, the
// two mapped points diverge and this test fails loudly.
