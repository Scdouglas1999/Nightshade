// The mosaic project header's "target region" claim must be TRUE.

// It derives the mosaic centre from the panel centres. RA was averaged
// arithmetically, which is invalid for an angle: a mosaic straddling RA 0h has
// panels at (e.g.) 23.97h and 0.03h, whose arithmetic mean is 12.0h. The header
// therefore stated, with full confidence and to the second, a centre on the
// exact opposite side of the sky from the grid it was describing — and the
// operator has nothing else on that screen to check it against.
//
// The Observatory overhaul turned the middot-joined subtitle into a ReadoutRow
// (Grid / Panels / Integrated / Centre), so the facts are now separate Texts
// instead of one sentence. The CLAIMS are unchanged and so are the assertions
// about them; the helper below reads the whole header rather than one string.
