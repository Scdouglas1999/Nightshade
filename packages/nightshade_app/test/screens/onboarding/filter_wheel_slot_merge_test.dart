// Unit tests for the onboarding filter-wheel slot/name seeding rule.
//
// Onboarding reads the DRIVER's real slot count and names rather than a fixed
// number. `mergeFilterSlotNames` is the pure core of that rule: the result must
// always have the device's slot count, while preserving any names the user has
// already typed in the draft.
