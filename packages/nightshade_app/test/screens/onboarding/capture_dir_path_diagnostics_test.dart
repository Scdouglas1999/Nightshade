// Two live findings from the onboarding capture-folder step (Step 10 of 13),
// both reproduced by driving the release build on a scratch profile:
//
//  * typing `/root` — a folder that exists but this process cannot write —
//    answered "Not writable: Cannot open file". That is dart:io's generic
//    phrase; the actual reason (Permission denied) sits in OSError and was
//    thrown away, so every rejection read the same and none of them said what
//    to do about it.
//  * typing `~/Documents` answered "That folder does not exist." even though it
//    does. A tilde path is what people paste out of a terminal and dart:io does
//    not expand it.
