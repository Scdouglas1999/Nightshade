// The "What this will do at sequence start" card is the only place the app
// explains the strictness knob, so every check it names has to be one the
// pre-flight rules will actually raise. Two of them were hard-coded and lied:
// stale polar alignment was listed even at max-age 0 (where
// PolarAlignmentFreshnessRule returns nothing), directly contradicting the
// "check is disabled" line printed under it, and Lax promised that time drift
// becomes an info note when TimeSyncRule blocks >30 s in every mode.
