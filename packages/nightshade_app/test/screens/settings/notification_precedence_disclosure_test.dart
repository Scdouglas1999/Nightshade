// The Notifications leaf ships three overlapping systems at once and offers
// three near-identically named controls for "a sequence finished" — Built-in
// event alerts › Sequence complete, Push to Mobile › Sequence completed, and
// Per-event routing › Sequence Completed. The page has to say which one decides
// whether the operator's phone buzzes.
//
// Saying it wrong is worse than saying nothing. The three built-in switches are
// live gates: `NotificationService._shouldNotifyForEvent` aborts the whole
// dispatch for an event family whose flag is off. Presenting them as inert
// decoration — disabled, captioned "not read by any delivery path" — would drop
// meridian-flip alerts (that flag defaults to false) while refusing to let
// anyone turn them on. So the disclosure must stay accurate AND the switches
// must stay enabled.
