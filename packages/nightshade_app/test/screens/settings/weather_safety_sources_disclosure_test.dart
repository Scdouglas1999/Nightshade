// The page that owns the weather-safety master switch showed neither which
// safety sources are attached nor the fail mode that decides what "no source"
// means — the fail-mode selector lived on the Sequencer page, so the operator
// met the consequence of the shipped default only when a run refused to start.
//
// Asserted against WeatherSafetyPolicyRows, the widget the page renders for
// exactly these two rows: pumping the whole WeatherSafetySettings page hangs
// the flutter_test isolate at HEAD too, so it is not a usable seam.
