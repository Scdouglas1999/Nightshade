/// Live GUI drive 2026-08-10: Settings → General exposed
/// `toggle button: Start minimized` with NO on/off state, while the same
/// switch component on the Imaging screen published `[off]`. `SettingRow`
/// wraps every row in `MergeSemantics`, added earlier to bind the label to a
/// switch that was "correctly-toggled but ANONYMOUS".
///
/// This test asked the decisive question the accessibility tree could not: does
/// the MERGED node carry both the label and the toggled state?
///
/// **It does.** The merged node comes out as
/// `flags: [hasEnabledState, isEnabled, hasToggledState, isToggled],
/// label: "Start minimized\nLaunch app minimized to system tray"` — so the
/// widget layer is right, the merge did NOT trade the state away, and the loss
/// I measured is in the AT-SPI bridge or in how the audit harness reads it.
///
/// Kept as a regression guard: if a future change to `SettingRow` or
/// `NightshadeSwitch` drops either half, this fails at the widget layer where
/// it is cheap to see.
