// Settings > Delivery, left open, must not go on stating a failure the app's
// own retry sweep has already fixed.
//
// What was measured against the release bundle, with the embedded server armed
// so DeliveryRetrySweeper ran in-process (the normal rig configuration): the
// page read "destinationUnreachable: <path> is not on the filesystem right now
// — will retry (1 file owed)" at 04:00:34, the directory was created at
// 04:00:45, the sweep delivered the row at 04:01:04 and the file appeared on
// disk at 04:01:05 — and the still-open page read the SAME sentence at 04:01:58
// and again at 04:02:28 after clicking away to another settings section and
// back. Only a restart re-read the journal, because the settings shell keeps
// the section mounted so `autoDispose` never fires on navigation either.
//
// This test is shaped like that run: a real journal, a real destination
// directory on the filesystem that starts absent and is created mid-test, the
// real DeliveryRetrySweeper over the real transport factory writing real bytes,
// and the page never unmounted between the two reads.
