/// `kSettingsSectionIndex` listed the key, so every deep link and search hit
/// resolved successfully — to an Autofocus pane that did not contain the widget.
/// Repo-wide, `FocusModelSettings`'s only references were inside its own
/// declaration: a whole settings screen with no route into it, which the
/// coverage ledger recorded as "unreachable BY DESIGN FAULT, not by budget".
///
/// The alias is the load-bearing part of the contract, so both halves are
/// asserted here: the key still resolves to Autofocus, AND Autofocus actually
/// renders the pane.
