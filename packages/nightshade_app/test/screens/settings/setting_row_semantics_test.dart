/// A settings toggle must announce WHICH setting it is.
///
/// Two separate defects were measured on the running app, in sequence:
///   1. The switch exposed no accessibility semantics at all — Settings >
///      General reported ZERO checkable nodes and only five focusable ones, so
///      the 664 setting rows were unreachable by keyboard and unreadable by a
///      screen reader. Fixed in `NightshadeSwitch`.
///   2. With that fixed, the same screen exposed three toggle buttons reading
///      "off/ON/ON" with EMPTY NAMES. Assistive technology could say something
///      was on without being able to say what. The row owns the label, the
///      switch owns the state, and nothing bound them together.
///
/// This pins the second: the row must present as ONE node carrying both.
