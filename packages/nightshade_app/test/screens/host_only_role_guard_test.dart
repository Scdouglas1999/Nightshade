// A control that gates a HOST-ONLY surface must ask the client ROLE, never the
// backend type.
//
// The Darkroom and Session Review both read files that exist only on the
// imaging host — linear masters, full-resolution subs, their previews — so
// whether this machine may open them is a fact about what this process IS, and
// `isRemoteClientProvider` is what answers it. `backend is NetworkBackend`
// answers a different question: whether a remote connection is open RIGHT NOW.
// The two disagree for the whole of a client's life before its first handshake
// and again after every drop, and during exactly that window the type test says
// "not remote" about a machine that owns none of the host's rows.
//
// That confusion has now been fixed five separate times — the Darkroom screen,
// the Session Review screen, the master library card, the stack-result action,
// the session-detail dialog — and each fix left the class alive one file over.
// This is the guard, so there is no sixth: any file under `lib/screens/` that
// reaches one of the two host-only surfaces is scanned, and a backend-type test
// whose ANSWER is the value it produces fails the test.
//
// What is NOT an offence: `if (backend is NetworkBackend) { backend.call() }`.
// That promotes the backend to the client in order to USE it, which is a
// capability question with one honest answer — you cannot call a rig you are
// not connected to. Only binding the type test into a value ("am I remote?")
// is the wrong question, and that is the shape this scans for.
