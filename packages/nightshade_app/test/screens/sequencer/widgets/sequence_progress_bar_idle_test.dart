// The progress bar must not pump vsync while the run is not running.
//
// Measured before this was fixed: a run left PAUSED on the Sequencer screen
// held ~56 fps and ~62% of one core indefinitely, with nothing on screen
// moving. `_pulseController` was correctly stopped on pause, but the
// stall-detector's `Ticker` was started unconditionally in `initState` and
// stopped only in `dispose`. An active `Ticker` schedules a frame on every
// vsync whether or not anything is dirty, and the Flutter Linux embedder
// submits a full-window frame for every scheduled frame — so the bar kept the
// whole app awake to service a detector that is switched off while paused
// (`_stalledFor` returns null the moment `isRunning` is false).
//
// The bar is mounted for running AND paused: `sequencer_screen.dart` folds
// paused into its `isRunning` gate, which is why "paused" is not a state the
// widget can simply be unmounted out of.
