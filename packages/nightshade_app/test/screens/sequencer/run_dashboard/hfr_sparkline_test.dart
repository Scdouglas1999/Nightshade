// One HFR sparkline, drawn the same way up on every Run-dashboard surface.
//
// The dashboard carried two `_HfrSparklinePainter` classes — one in
// `quality_panel.dart`, one in `live_frame_panel.dart` — with the same name and
// the same purpose. They disagreed on the flat-series clamp (1e-3 vs 1e-6), on
// the stroke width, and on which way up the trend was drawn: the quality
// panel's `y = height * (1 - normalized)` put the LOWEST HFR at the BOTTOM,
// contradicting its own comment ("smaller HFR draws at the top") and mirroring
// the live-frame badge next to it. Both comments agree on the intent, so the
// merged painter takes the orientation both files documented.
