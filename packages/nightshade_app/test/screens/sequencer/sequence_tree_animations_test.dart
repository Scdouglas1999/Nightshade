// The sequencer tree's motion (spec §9).
//
// Two things are worth testing about an animation and neither is what it looks
// like. The first is that it is not there at all when the platform has asked
// for no motion — a transition that "only" runs for 120 ms is still motion on
// screen, and the failure mode is silent. The second is the structure the
// motion depends on: a repeating animation lives inside an
// `OnScreenAnimationGate`, and the gate decides whether to keep running by
// watching whether its child PAINTS — so a `RepaintBoundary` on the wrong side
// of it stops the animation two ticks in and nothing says so.
