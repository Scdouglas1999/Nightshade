/// Make a just-written export file reachable by the operator.
///
/// Every in-app export writes to `resolveNightshadeDocumentsDirectory()`. On
/// desktop that path is user-accessible, so an `Exported to <path>` snackbar
/// is actionable. On a PHONE/TABLET it is the app's PRIVATE sandbox — the same
/// snackbar named a file the user can never open in Files/Photos/Drive. This
/// helper closes that gap: on mobile it hands the file to the system share
/// sheet (Save to Files, email, Drive, …); on desktop it keeps the path
/// snackbar. Call it immediately after the file is written.
///
/// [subject] is the share-sheet title / email subject on mobile.
/// [desktopMessage] overrides the desktop snackbar (defaults to a path line).
/// [desktopDuration] overrides how long that snackbar stays up — long paths
/// (e.g. a diagnostic dump the user has to copy into a bug report) need more
/// than the default few seconds.
