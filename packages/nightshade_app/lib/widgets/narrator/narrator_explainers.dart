  // Discovery
  'discovery.moving_object':
      "Something in your field moved between frames against the fixed stars — "
          "usually an asteroid, a comet, or a satellite caught mid-pass. The rate "
          "and brightness tell you which. If it's a real minor planet, a short "
          "follow-up set of frames can turn this into a genuine astrometric "
          "contribution.",
  'discovery.lightcurve_event':
      "Your target's brightness has drifted well beyond its usual scatter for "
          "several frames running — not noise, a real change in the star itself. "
          "A steady fade or brightening like this is exactly the signature of an "
          "eclipse, a transit, or a flare. Keep the cadence steady; the shape of "
          "the curve is the science.",
  'discovery.period_found':
      "The photometry you've been gathering now folds onto a clean, repeating "
          "cycle, and the statistics say it's very unlikely to be chance. That "
          "period is a physical clock — an orbit, a rotation, or a pulsation. "
          "It's the kind of result that makes a night's worth of subs worth it.",

  // First light (difference imaging)
  'first_light.transient':
      "A clean, round point of light is sitting in your difference image where "
          "your deep template of this field was empty — and it matches nothing in "
          "the catalog. That's the classic signature of a genuine transient: a "
          "nova, a supernova, or an outburst nobody has logged yet. Re-image to "
          "confirm it's real and not a cosmic-ray hit, then it's worth a report "
          "to AAVSO or the TNS.",
  'first_light.brightening':
      "A source you've imaged before has jumped well above its usual brightness "
          "in this frame's difference image — a real change, not measurement "
          "scatter. Sudden brightening like this is how dwarf-nova outbursts, "
          "stellar flares, and AGN flickers announce themselves. Keep watching "
          "it: the rise and fall is the science.",
  'first_light.mover':
      "An elongated residual streaked across your difference image, and its "
          "shape says it moved between exposures rather than sitting still like a "
          "star. That's almost always a minor planet or a satellite caught "
          "mid-pass. A short follow-up set, timed and measured, can turn a "
          "passing streak into a real astrometric position.",

  // Milestone
  'milestone.limiting_mag':
      "This is how faint your rig is actually reaching tonight, measured from "
          "real stars rather than a spec sheet. Deeper limiting magnitude means "
          "fainter targets are within reach. When this number improves it usually "
          "means transparency, focus, or guiding just got better.",
  'milestone.calibration_locked':
      "Your photometric zero-point has held steady across the last several "
          "frames, which means the sky and your optics are behaving and your "
          "brightness measurements can be trusted. Locked calibration is the "
          "foundation under every light curve and magnitude you'll report from "
          "tonight.",
  'milestone.best_seeing':
      "The atmosphere just handed you your tightest stars of the night — this "
          "frame's FWHM is in the best slice of everything you've captured. These "
          "are the moments worth pointing your sharpest, faintest targets at. "
          "Seeing comes in pockets, so enjoy it while it lasts.",
  'milestone.integration':
      "You've crossed another whole hour of accumulated exposure on this "
          "target and filter. Integration time is the single biggest lever on "
          "signal-to-noise: more hours means smoother backgrounds and fainter "
          "detail surviving the stretch. Steady progress is how deep images get "
          "made.",

  // Conditions
  'conditions.transparency_trend':
      "The sky's clarity has been trending in one direction long enough to be "
          "a real change, not a passing wisp. Improving transparency lets more "
          "starlight through and deepens your frames; declining transparency "
          "quietly eats your faint signal. It's worth knowing which way the night "
          "is heading.",
  'conditions.sky_darkness':
      "Your sky-quality meter shows the background getting measurably darker "
          "as the night settles — light domes fade, the Moon sets, the air "
          "steadies. A darker sky directly extends how faint you can go. This is "
          "the window to chase your most demanding targets.",
  'conditions.clouds_vs_focus':
      "Star counts dropped, and the Narrator cross-checked transparency, "
          "weather, and HFR to tell you why. That distinction matters: clouds "
          "pass on their own and you just wait them out, but focus drift needs a "
          "refocus before you waste more subs. Knowing which is which saves the "
          "session.",
  'conditions.excellent':
      "Transparency has been excellent and steady for a good stretch — the "
          "kind of clean, dark window that doesn't come every night. This is when "
          "your narrowest filters and faintest objects pay off the most. If "
          "you've been saving a hard target, now is the moment.",

  // Equipment
  'equipment.tilt':
      "Stars in one corner of the frame are consistently softer than the "
          "rest, which points to the sensor sitting slightly out of plane with "
          "the optical axis — sensor tilt. It robs sharpness from part of every "
          "sub and won't fix itself. The Diagnostics screen shows the per-corner "
          "map you'd use to chase it down.",
  'equipment.focus_drift':
      "Your rolling HFR has crept above the baseline you set at the last "
          "autofocus, often as the temperature falls and the tube contracts. Left "
          "alone, every new frame is a little softer than it should be. A quick "
          "refocus pulls the stars back to where they belong.",
  'equipment.gradient':
      "A brightness gradient has been sitting on the same edge of your frames "
          "for several subs — typically stray light, a neighbour's window, or a "
          "light-pollution dome leaking in from one direction. It complicates "
          "calibration and flattening later. Worth chasing the source or flagging "
          "the offending frames.",
  'equipment.guiding_degraded':
      "Your guiding RMS has climbed well above its earlier baseline for this "
          "session and stayed there. Loose guiding bloats stars and can trip your "
          "frame grader into rejecting subs. Wind, balance, or worsening seeing "
          "are the usual suspects — a glance at the guide graph usually tells you "
          "which.",

  // Quality / pipeline
  'quality.clipping':
      "Several frames in a row are clipping — pixels pinned at the bright or "
          "dark rail where real data should be. Clipped highlights burn out star "
          "cores and clipped shadows crush faint structure, and neither comes "
          "back in processing. Easing exposure, gain, or offset usually recovers "
          "the headroom.",
  'quality.reject_burst':
      "Your auto-grader just rejected several consecutive frames for the same "
          "reason, so this isn't one unlucky sub — something changed. The named "
          "cause points straight at the fix, whether that's focus, guiding, or a "
          "passing cloud. Catching a reject burst early saves a chunk of the "
          "night.",
  'quality.solve_drop':
      "Plate solving was working and has now started failing on most recent "
          "frames. Since solving underpins centering, dithering, and meridian "
          "flips, a drop here can quietly derail the automation. It usually traces "
          "to clouds, focus loss, or a sudden star-count collapse.",
  'quality.pipeline_failure':
      "A stage of the science pipeline failed to process a frame, so the "
          "measurements that stage produces are missing for it. One failure is "
          "rarely fatal, but a recurring one means a real problem upstream worth "
          "investigating. The Diagnostics screen has the detail on what broke.",
