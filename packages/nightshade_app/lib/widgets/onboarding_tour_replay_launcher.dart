/// Mounts the [OnboardingOverlay] above the app shell whenever the first-launch
/// tour's persisted status is [FirstLaunchTourStatus.pending].
///
/// The tour is REPLAY-ONLY — the equipment onboarding spine owns first-run
/// setup. Settings → Help & Tutorials → "Re-run onboarding tour" calls
/// [OnboardingTourNotifier.reset], which flips the persisted status back to
/// pending and invalidates [firstLaunchTourStatusProvider]; this launcher
/// watches that provider and overlays the tour on the running app, so the
/// replay button works without a restart.
///
/// `pending` means "a replay was explicitly requested and is unfinished". A
/// brand-new install has no row at all and reads as
/// [FirstLaunchTourStatus.notStarted], which mounts nothing.
///
/// The overlay sits in a [Stack] above [child] (rather than as a route) so it
/// floats over whatever screen the user is on — exactly where the per-step
/// spotlight cutouts need to be to highlight the live navigation chrome. When
/// the user completes or skips the tour, [OnboardingTourNotifier] persists the
/// terminal status and invalidates the provider, so this launcher tears the
/// overlay down on the next rebuild.
