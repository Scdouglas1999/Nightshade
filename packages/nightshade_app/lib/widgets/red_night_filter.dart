// The red-night filter for IMAGE DATA.
//
// Red night exists to protect a dark-adapted eye, which is why 02 and 03 put
// every chrome pixel on the red axis (G == B). Chrome gets there by using the
// red-night palette. Image data cannot: a radar map, an astro frame, a
// thumbnail and a Darkroom preview all arrive as arbitrary RGB, and a
// full-screen magenta-and-green cloud overlay defeats the theme however
// honestly it encodes rainfall.
//
// So image data is filtered rather than recoloured: luminance is preserved and
// re-emitted on the red axis, which keeps every structure the operator needs to
// read (cloud bands, star fields, gradients) while emitting no green or blue
// the eye has to re-adapt from.

/// Wraps [child] in the red-axis filter when the red-night theme is active,
/// and returns it untouched in every other theme.

/// Use this at EVERY site that paints pixels Nightshade did not choose: the
/// weather radar/satellite map, the Imaging frame and live stack, frame
/// thumbnails, the Darkroom preview. Chrome must NOT use it — chrome is already
/// on the red axis by palette, and filtering it a second time would crush the
