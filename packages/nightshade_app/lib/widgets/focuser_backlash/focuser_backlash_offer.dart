/// The ONE place an autofocus launch is intercepted to offer a backlash
/// measurement.
///
/// Four surfaces start autofocus (the focuser control strip, the imaging focus
/// panel, the dashboard quick action and the focus-model card's empty state).
/// The interception lives here so the offer cannot drift into four different
/// promises, and so there is one place to read what it does.
///
/// The rules it enforces:
///   * The offer is an OFFER. Declining runs the focus operation immediately —
///     it must never block an imaging run.
///   * "Skip and focus now" and "Don't ask again" are different promises and
///     are never conflated. The first is one session, the second is persisted
///     through `declineOffer(never: true)`.
///   * Nothing is offered unless a focuser is connected and
///     [focuserBacklashOfferProvider] says a measurement is due, so app launch
///     with no hardware is silent.
