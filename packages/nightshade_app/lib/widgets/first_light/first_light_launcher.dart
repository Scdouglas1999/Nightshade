/// Wraps the imaging screen body and opens the [FirstLightFlowDialog] when the
/// imaging route is reached with `?firstLight=1`.
///
/// ## Why a wrapper widget (and the ownership contract)
///
/// The first-light "wow moment" is launched by sending the user to
/// `/imaging?firstLight=1` (C9 routes here once equipment onboarding finishes).
/// We want the dialog to open exactly once on arrival and never re-trigger on
/// later rebuilds, so the launcher:
///
///   1. Reads the `firstLight` query parameter from [GoRouterState.of].
///   2. On the first post-frame callback after that query is seen (mounted-
///      guarded), opens [FirstLightFlowDialog.show].
///   3. Strips the query by calling `context.go('/imaging')` so a rebuild,
///      back-navigation, or hot reload cannot fire the dialog a second time.
///
/// This is provided as a wrapper widget so that the eventual imaging-screen /
/// router change is minimal. **This component deliberately does NOT edit
/// `imaging_screen.dart` or `app_router.dart`** — to preserve exclusive file
/// ownership, mounting the launcher is the job of the `/imaging` `pageBuilder`,
/// which is owned by C13. The integration contract C13 must honour:
///
/// ```dart
/// // in app_router.dart, the /imaging GoRoute pageBuilder:
/// pageBuilder: (context, state) => CustomTransitionPage(
///   child: const FirstLightQueryLauncher(child: ImagingScreen()),
///   transitionsBuilder: PageTransitions.slideFadeTransition,
///   transitionDuration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
/// ),
/// ```
///
/// The launcher is intentionally inert (renders [child] unchanged) unless the
/// `firstLight=1` query is present, so wrapping the imaging screen with it
/// unconditionally is safe.
