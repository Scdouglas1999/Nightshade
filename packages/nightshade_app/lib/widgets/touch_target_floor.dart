/// Floors an interactive child's hit-testable box at the platform touch
/// minimum, while leaving the child PAINTED at its own (usually smaller) size.
///
/// Why this exists: several controls set an explicit `width`/`height` on the
/// box inside their `InkWell`/`GestureDetector`, which makes the visual size and
/// the touch size the same thing. Measured against Flutter's
/// `androidTapTargetGuideline`, that left real controls under the 48dp minimum
/// (e.g. the dashboard's Glance-mode toggle at 36.0x36.0 on every phone width).
/// Material's own `IconButton` avoids this by padding a 24dp icon out to 48dp;
/// this widget applies the same separation to bespoke controls.
///
/// The floor itself comes from [NightshadeTouchTarget], so this widget and
/// every other platform-aware control agree on one number. Grows on touch
/// platforms only, so dense desktop panels do not reflow for an imprecision a
/// mouse does not have.
