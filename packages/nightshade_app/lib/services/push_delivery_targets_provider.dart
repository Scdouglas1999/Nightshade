/// The "Push critical alerts to mobile" row used to render as a plain ON
/// switch whatever the real delivery state was. On Android that claim was
/// never true in a stock build — the FCM client is a dormant scaffold pending
/// Firebase provisioning (`apps/mobile/android/app/google-services.json` is
/// absent), so the phone logs
/// `FCM not configured (no google-services.json); push registration dormant`
/// and never registers a token. The switch therefore asserted a capability the
/// system did not have.
///
/// Two authorities answer the question, depending on where this code runs:
///   * a remote controller (phone/tablet paired to a host) asks the host over
///     `GET /api/push/targets` — its own local pairing DB knows nothing about
///     who has registered with the host;
///   * the host itself reads the same `PairingDatabase` its headless server
///     writes push tokens into, plus the on-disk `push_config.json` that
///     decides whether a cloud channel exists at all.
