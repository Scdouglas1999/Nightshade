/// Mirrors the persisted observer location into the planetarium provider and the
/// Rust backend. Settings is the single source of truth; this only fans changes
/// out. Uses `ref.listen` to avoid modifying providers during build.
///
/// This deliberately does **not** auto-detect a location on first launch. Free
/// IP services resolve to the ISP's egress point and disagree with each other
/// by a hundred kilometres or more, yet a persisted estimate is rendered
/// exactly like a site the user typed — twilight times, the astro-dark
/// countdown and the imaging window all quoted off it with no hint that
/// anything is approximate.
///
/// 0/0 is the designed "not set" sentinel and every location-driven surface has
/// an honest empty state for it. The estimate stays one click away: the
/// onboarding observing-site step offers it as a labelled suggestion, and
/// Settings → Location has the same affordance.
///
/// The Rust backend is the one consumer that must NOT receive the sentinel.
/// Its site is `Option<ObserverLocation>`, `None` is its only way to say "no
/// site", and every native consumer reads a `Some` as a site the user chose:
/// the simulated mount reported a parked altitude of −78° on a fresh install
/// because this provider had handed it 0/0/0 as a real site, and the Dashboard
/// printed that number beside a status bar that said `LST --:--`. So the
/// backend is given [AppSettingsState.observerSite] — null until the user sets
/// a site — while the planetarium provider below keeps receiving the raw
/// geometry, for the reason given at the initial-value push.

  // change had fired yet: before one, it held the package's Los Angeles
  // constructor default; after one, the 0/0 sentinel. Both are wrong for an
  // unconfigured site and neither is distinguishable from a real site, so the
  // two paths agree on one value instead.
  //
  // "Is there a site at all" is not this provider's question to answer —
  // `observerLocationProvider` is non-nullable geometry. Surfaces that must
  // not invent a night gate on `observingSiteProvider` /
  // `appObserverLocationProvider`, which return null at the 0/0 sentinel.
