/// (resumable, byte-streamed) and `NetworkBackend.downloadImage` is a robust
/// resumable client — but NOTHING in the UI ever called it. A phone paired to
/// the Pi could see 512px thumbnails yet had no way to pull the real
/// FITS/processed frame onto the device. This wires that gap with a single
/// reusable entry point (see `downloadImageToDevice`).
///
/// The destination handling (temp file → share sheet / save picker) is the
/// generic [downloadFileToDevice]; these aliases keep the image-flavoured
/// names its callers and tests use.

///     file is moved to the chosen location.
///   * Mobile (Android/iOS): the system share sheet (`share_plus`) so the
///     operator can drop it into Photos, Files, Drive, etc.

/// This works over a remote pairing (the host streams the bytes) AND for a
/// local host (the client backend copies its own file). Progress is reported
/// through [onProgress] in `[0, 1]`.
