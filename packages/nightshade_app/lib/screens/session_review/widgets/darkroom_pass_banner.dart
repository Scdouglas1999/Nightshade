/// States what a Darkroom pass did with this night.
///
/// The Darkroom pass is what turns a night's masters into drafts, a night
/// report and a delivery. When it runs at dawn nobody is standing at the
/// machine, so its ending lives only on its `darkroom_jobs` row — the toast
/// that reports a pass belongs to the button that started one. A pass that
/// failed at 05:40 therefore left this screen showing the night's verdict, the
/// masters and the score with nothing saying the drafting and the delivery had
/// not happened, and the operator's first sign of it was a destination that
/// never received the night.
///
/// Renders nothing for a pass that is still running — that one has the screen's
/// own progress strip.
///
/// A pass that ran to the END gets a line too, and that is not decoration. The
/// dawn pass finishes while nobody is at the machine and its only durable
/// account is its `darkroom_jobs` row: measured against a completed D1 night —
/// one `done` job, four autopilot recipes, four rendered drafts, nine delivered
/// files — the Dashboard, the status bar and this screen said NOTHING about any
/// of it, and the only way to the drafts was an unlabelled icon in an Analytics
/// session dialog. The morning notification's `darkroom_draft:` deep link is
/// routed by the phone alone, so on the desktop the pass had no surface at all.
/// This is that surface: the ending, in the place the operator opens to look at
/// the night, with the way to what it made.
///
/// A `queued` pass DOES get one, because that is what a night still owed its
/// drafts looks like on this screen. The autopilot queues and runs in one
/// breath, so a live pass is past `queued` in milliseconds; a row that is still
/// there when the screen is drawn is a pass nothing has picked up — the state
/// the open-time recovery leaves after it finds an integrate that finished and
/// a pass that was never queued, and the state a drain that could not run
/// leaves behind.
///
/// Null stays silent, and that reading is exact rather than a fallback: the
/// pass that was owed becomes a `queued` row before any screen can be drawn
/// over it (see `NightshadeDatabase._reportInterruptedIntegration`), so a
/// session with no row is a session where no pass was ever owed — automatic
/// drafting off, or no masters to draft. The one case where a pass is owed and
/// has no row is a recovery whose insert itself failed, and that night's
/// `SessionInterruptionBanner` states it in full from the same marker stage
/// this row came from.
