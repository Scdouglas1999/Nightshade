// Component C8 (attribution half) — the HiPS survey attribution badge.
//
// CDS and the survey publishers ask HiPS clients to display the survey's
// `obs_copyright` credit whenever its imagery is shown (it is part of the data
// licence, e.g. the STScI Digitized Sky Survey acknowledgement that must
// accompany any DSS-derived image). This badge renders that credit, parsed from
// the survey `properties` document into [HipsProperties.obsCopyright] /
// [HipsProperties.creator], in the design system's quiet on-canvas chrome style
// — and only while HiPS imagery is actually visible.
//
// It is a small, pure presentation widget: it takes the resolved
// [HipsProperties] (or `null` when none is resolved) and whether the layer is
// currently showing imagery, and renders the credit pill or nothing. It owns no
// fetch logic and no provider reads, so it composes cleanly into the framing
// `Stack` next to the tile layer and is trivially testable.
//
// When the survey publishes an [HipsProperties.obsCopyrightUrl] the badge is
// tappable and opens it in the external browser (the canonical
// attribution-page link), matching how the settings screens launch external
// URLs. When no URL is published the badge is non-interactive text.
