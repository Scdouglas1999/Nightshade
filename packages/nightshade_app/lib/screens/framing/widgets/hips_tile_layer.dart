// Component C8 (widget half) — the Flutter-side GPU HiPS framing tile layer.
//
// This is the [ConsumerWidget] the framing screen inserts into the framing
// render path's `Stack` as the bottom-most *imagery* layer (above the starfield
// fallback, under the grid and the FOV/mosaic overlays). It does three jobs and
// nothing else:
//
//   1. **Drive the loader.** On every layout pass and every framing-state change
//      (target, survey, zoom, pan, rotation) it measures the real canvas with a
//      [LayoutBuilder], resolves the SAME [FramingPlateScale] the survey
//      background and overlays use (via the shared canvas resolution rule), and
//      pushes that exact viewport into the C6 [HipsTileLoader] through the C7
//      [hipsResidentTilesProvider] notifier. The loader debounces / dedups /
//      cancels internally, so this widget may push on every frame without
//      thrashing the network.
//   2. **Resolve survey metadata.** A HiPS view needs the survey `properties`
//      (order range + tile width + preferred format) to drive LOD selection.
//      This widget watches the single shared [framingHipsPropertiesProvider]
//      (fetched once per survey through the C5 fetcher, also consumed by the
//      attribution badge), so a survey switch fetches the document once, pan/zoom
//      never re-fetch it, and there is exactly one fetch / cache / error surface
//      per survey.
//   3. **Paint the resident snapshot.** It watches [hipsResidentTilesProvider]
//      and hands the versioned [HipsResidentSnapshot] to [HipsTileLayerPainter],
//      which composites the resident tiles as GPU textured meshes. When the
//      layer is inactive (feature off, or the survey has no verified HiPS
//      pyramid) or has no imagery yet, it paints nothing and stays fully
//      transparent so the framing canvas's existing single survey snapshot /
//      starfield shows through as the outermost never-blank fallback.
//
// ## Platform independence (hard requirement)
//
// Nothing here reads the planetarium `RenderingPlatform` or touches the
// planetarium renderer (v1 CustomPainter or experimental v2 wgpu). The HiPS
// tiles are a Flutter-side, GPU-composited layer inside the framing render path,
// so HiPS framing works for every user regardless of the rendering-platform
// setting.
//
// ## No FramingCanvas prop changes
//
// This widget is fully self-contained: it measures its own canvas, resolves its
// own plate scale with the shared rule, and reads framing state from the
// provider. The framing screen drops it into the `Stack` at the background
// z-index without adding a single parameter to [FramingCanvas]. It is wrapped in
// an [IgnorePointer] so pan/rotate gestures fall through to the canvas beneath.
//
// ## Errors are a feature
//
// A `properties` fetch failure is surfaced (logged via the loader's error sink
// path and exposed through [HipsLayerPropertiesState]); the layer then stays
// transparent and the single survey snapshot remains visible — never a silent
// blank. Per-tile fetch failures are surfaced by the loader into the snapshot's
// `failures` list (an attribution/diagnostic concern handled by the screen).
