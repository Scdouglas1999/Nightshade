// Component C8b — framing-screen wiring for the Flutter-side GPU HiPS tile layer.
//
// This is the single, self-contained widget the framing screen composes into its
// `Expanded > Stack` (next to `FramingCanvas`) so the C8 [HipsTileLayer] and its
// [HipsAttributionBadge] appear at the right z-order, gated by the C7
// [hipsFramingActiveProvider] (the user toggle [hipsFramingEnabledProvider]
// combined with the survey's HiPS capability gate). It owns no rendering, no
// fetching and no geometry of its own: it is pure composition, layering the
// already-built C8 widgets and the survey-attribution credit over the framing
// imagery band.
//
// ## Where it sits in the framing render path (z-order)
//
// The framing imagery is composited by the framing render path's own widgets —
// the opaque [FramingCanvas] (survey-snapshot painter / starfield fallback *and*
// the grid / FOV / mosaic overlays, all in one internal `Stack`). The HiPS tile
// layer is a Flutter-side, GPU-composited imagery layer that streams a deep,
// zoomable tile mosaic registered to the SAME [FramingPlateScale] the canvas and
// its overlays use, so it co-registers to the pixel at every zoom.
//
// This wiring stacks the HiPS tile layer directly OVER the framing canvas: the
// canvas is the outermost never-blank fallback (its single survey snapshot or
// starfield shows through wherever the tile mosaic has no imagery yet — the C8
// painter draws nothing outside the resident tile footprint and stays
// transparent until imagery is resident), and the streamed HiPS mosaic is the
// sharp imagery on top. The tile layer is wrapped in [IgnorePointer] inside C8,
// so pan / rotate gestures fall straight through to the canvas beneath; this
// wiring adds its own [IgnorePointer] guarantee around the imagery + badge so the
// composed group never intercepts a gesture meant for the canvas.
//
// ## Platform independence (hard requirement)
//
// Nothing here touches the planetarium renderer. The framing background is its
// own Flutter render path; the HiPS tiles are a Flutter-side GPU layer inside
// it, so HiPS framing works independently of the planetarium screen.
//
// ## Attribution (a licence requirement, not chrome)
//
// CDS and the survey publishers require the survey's `obs_copyright` credit to be
// displayed whenever its imagery is shown. This wiring resolves the survey's HiPS
// `properties` once per survey (via [framingHipsPropertiesProvider], built on the
// shared C5 fetcher so no extra network client is created) and renders the C8
// [HipsAttributionBadge] only while the HiPS layer is active AND actually showing
// imagery. A properties-fetch failure is surfaced (logged + the future carries
// the error) and the badge simply renders nothing — the imagery already falls
// back to the canvas snapshot, so there is never a silent blank.

// The survey `properties` document is resolved by the single shared
// [framingHipsPropertiesProvider] in nightshade_core (the C7 provider surface,
// exported via the barrel above), so the tile layer/loader and this attribution
// badge consume ONE fetch / one cache / one error surface per survey rather than
// fetching the identical immutable document twice over divergent code paths.

/// Composes the C8 HiPS tile layer + attribution badge over the framing imagery
/// band, gated by the C7 active-for-survey decision.
///
/// Drop this into the framing screen's `Expanded > Stack` as a [Positioned.fill]
/// directly above the [FramingCanvas]: the canvas is the never-blank fallback
/// underneath, and this layer streams the sharp HiPS mosaic on top, with the
/// survey attribution credit in the canvas's quiet bottom-left chrome band.
///
/// When the layer is inactive for the current survey (feature off, or the survey
/// has no verified HiPS pyramid) this renders a zero-cost transparent box, so the
/// framing canvas's existing single survey snapshot / starfield is the only
/// background — exactly the pre-HiPS behaviour, untouched.
