// Component C8 (painter half) — the Flutter-side GPU HiPS framing tile painter.
//
// This is the *compositor* of the Flutter-side HiPS framing tile layer. It
// takes the immutable, versioned [HipsResidentSnapshot] the C6 loader produced
// (resident decoded tiles, each with the screen-space mesh C3 projected through
// the shared framing projection) and draws them into the framing canvas — into
// the *exact same* canvas coordinate space the survey-image background and the
// FOV/mosaic overlays use, so the tiles register to the overlays to the pixel
// at every zoom/pan/rotation.
//
// ## Why this is its own painter, not part of FramingSurveyImagePainter
//
// The single-cutout survey background draws one [ui.Image] into one
// `drawImageRect`. A HiPS view is a *mosaic* of many small tiles, each a curved
// HEALPix diamond that must follow the sky's curvature and the field rotation —
// a single flat quad per tile would leave visible seams between neighbours and
// bow the imagery at wide FOV. So each tile is drawn as a fine textured
// triangle **mesh** (`drawVertices`), warping its image onto the projected sky
// footprint C3 computed. Adjacent tiles share byte-identical boundary sky points
// (C3 builds the mesh from the same HEALPix boundary routine), so their
// projected edges coincide and the mosaic is seam-free.
//
// ## The anti-jank contract this painter upholds (by item)
//
//  4. **Never blank.** The painter draws, bottom to top: (a) the Allsky
//     whole-sky base, (b) the coarse *fallback* tiles (a resident lower-order
//     ancestor stretched across a not-yet-loaded sharp tile's footprint), then
//     (c) the sharp *primary* tiles on top. A region whose sharp tile is still
//     streaming therefore shows a softer coarse tile (or the Allsky), never
//     black. When the snapshot has no imagery at all the painter draws nothing
//     and the layer is fully transparent, so the framing canvas's existing
//     single survey snapshot / starfield shows through underneath — the
//     outermost never-blank fallback.
//  5. **Seam-free.** Mesh vertices come straight from C3 (shared HEALPix
//     boundaries); this painter never re-derives geometry, so neighbours stay
//     gapless. A 1px overdraw inset on the texture sampling avoids edge-bleed
//     halos from neighbouring tiles packed in an atlas-less decode while keeping
//     the *position* mesh exact.
//  6. **GPU compositing only.** Every pixel is moved by `Canvas.drawVertices`
//     (textured triangles uploaded to the GPU) with [FilterQuality.high] — the
//     sharp tiles, the coarse fallback ancestors, AND the coarse Allsky cells
//     all draw through the same mesh path. There is no per-frame CPU pixel work,
//     no `getBytes`, no software blend.
//  7. **Registration.** Every layer is a textured mesh whose vertices C3 already
//     projected through the shared framing projection — which bakes in pan,
//     zoom and rotation about the canvas centre, identically to the survey
//     background and the FOV/mosaic overlays. So the painter draws the meshes
//     *verbatim* and never applies its own canvas transform; re-rotating would
//     double-apply the field rotation and de-register the tiles. Even the coarse
//     Allsky base is sampled per visible cell and warped onto the *same* visible
//     meshes, so it too registers to the FOV overlay rather than being a
//     meaningless full-image stretch.
//
// `shouldRepaint` is gated on the cheap snapshot [HipsResidentSnapshot.version]
// (a monotonic integer the loader bumps on every meaningful change — including
// every view movement, which produces a new snapshot with fresh meshes), so a
// stationary view with no new tiles does not repaint, and a one-tile arrival or
// a pan/zoom/rotate repaints exactly once.
//
// This painter performs NO I/O, NO fetching, NO Riverpod reads: it is handed a
// finished snapshot and paints it. It is therefore trivially unit-testable by
// replaying it into a recording canvas (see the C8 painter test) to assert tile
// destination geometry registers against the FOV overlay rect.
