// The planetarium's sky-survey imagery layer: real DSS imagery streamed behind
// the star chart at the narrow fields where the catalogue runs out.
//
// ## The problem it solves
//
// The chart is drawn from the HYG catalogue — ~118,000 stars, about 2.9 per
// square degree. At a 1.5-degree field centred on M42 that is fifteen stars on
// an otherwise empty screen. A 1.5-degree field is an ordinary imaging field,
// so the planetarium was at its least useful exactly where an imager needs it
// most: deciding how to frame a target. Real imagery fixes that, and the app
// already had the machinery — a complete HiPS stack built for the framing
// screen. This layer is the wiring, not a second implementation.
//
// ## What it does, and does not, own
//
// It owns: when to run, where each tile lands on the planetarium's canvas, and
// staying quiet when the network is not there.
//
// It does not own: fetching, decoding, caching, debouncing, cancellation or the
// never-blank level-of-detail strategy. All of that is nightshade_core's shared
// `HipsTileLoader` (reached through the C7 [hipsResidentTilesProvider]) — the
// same instance the framing screen drives, so there is one tile cache in the
// process, not two.
//
// ## Registration
//
// Tiles have to land where the stars say they should; imagery that disagrees
// with the chart is worse than no imagery. The loader's own meshes are built
// through the *framing* screen's projection, which the planetarium does not
// use, so they are discarded and rebuilt through [SkyFovProjector] — the public
// mirror of `SkyCanvasPainter`'s geometry, pinned against the painter's real
// output by test. See `planetarium_sky_geometry.dart`.
//
// ## Offline is the normal case
//
// An observatory laptop on an isolated LAN cannot reach CDS. Every failure path
// here ends in "show the star chart": a failed `properties` fetch leaves the
// layer transparent, failed tiles leave it transparent, and after a batch that
// produces failures and no imagery at all the layer stops asking for a while
// rather than re-issuing dozens of doomed requests on every pan. No banner, no
// dialog, no exception.
