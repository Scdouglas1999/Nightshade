// Geometry bridge between the planetarium's sky projection and the HiPS tile
// pyramid — the part of the sky-imagery layer that decides *where on the
// planetarium canvas* each survey tile lands.
//
// ## Why this file exists at all
//
// nightshade_core already owns a complete, tested HiPS stack: HEALPix indexing,
// LOD selection, tile fetch/decode, a bounded LRU cache, and a debounced loader
// that turns a moving viewport into a never-blank set of resident tiles. All of
// that is reused verbatim here.
//
// One piece is not reusable: `HipsTileSelection.computeVisibleTiles` builds its
// screen meshes by constructing a `FramingSkyProjection` *internally*, from the
// framing screen's plate scale. It exposes no seam for an arbitrary projection
// function. The planetarium does not use that projection — it uses
// `SkyCanvasPainter`'s (mirrored publicly by [SkyFovProjector]), which is a
// different family of projections entirely: stereographic / orthographic /
// azimuthal-equidistant, optionally in the alt-az frame, with a view rotation.
// Feeding framing-projected meshes into the planetarium would put the imagery
// in visibly the wrong place — the very failure mode that makes an overlay
// worse than no overlay.
//
// So this file re-derives ONE thing — the per-tile screen mesh — through
// [SkyFovProjector], and reuses everything else. It deliberately mirrors
// `HipsTileSelection._buildMesh` vertex-for-vertex (same fractional intra-face
// lattice, same `(u, v)` parameterisation, same [HealpixNested.xyfToAng] call)
// so that the painter's verified tile-image transpose (`tx = v, ty = u`) stays
// valid and neighbouring tiles keep sharing byte-identical boundary sky points,
// i.e. stay seam-free.
//
// ## What is reused, unchanged
//
//   * [HealpixNested] — sky <-> tile index and the fractional cell lattice.
//   * [HipsTileSelection.selectNorder] — the LOD rule.
//   * `HipsTileLoader` / `HipsTileCache` / `HipsTileFetcher` (via the C7
//     providers) — the one and only fetch + residency path. There is no second
//     cache here; [reproject] reads the loader's own cache snapshot.
//   * `HipsTileLayerPainter` — the GPU compositor, fed a rebuilt snapshot.
//
// Pure Dart + `dart:ui` geometry: no widgets, no Riverpod, no I/O, so the
// registration test can drive it directly.
