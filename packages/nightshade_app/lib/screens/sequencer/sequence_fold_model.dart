/// Run-length folding for the sequence tree — the MODEL half of spec §6.
///
/// In Ledger density the tree collapses two kinds of contiguous sibling runs
/// into a single row:
///
///   * a `filterRun` — ≥2 enabled [ExposureNode]s identical in every capture
///     field except `filter`/`filterIndex` (the classic "same subs through a
///     filter wheel" block: `Ha · OIII · SII`, `300 s ×12 each`);
///   * an `acquireTarget` — the 3-or-4-leaf run of slew / center / start
///     guiding / autofocus that opens a target (`Acquire target`).
///
/// This file is deliberately Flutter-free: it is pure Dart over
/// `nightshade_core` so the fold logic stays trivially unit-testable and can
/// run on every tree build without touching the widget layer. The riverpod
/// view-state (`unfoldedGroupIdsProvider`) and the `VisibleNode` projection
/// (`applyFoldsToVisibleOrder`) live in the sibling `sequence_fold_state.dart`
/// precisely because they need imports (`VisibleNode` is declared in
/// `sequence_tree_shortcuts.dart`, which pulls in `flutter/material`) that
/// would break this file's purity.
///
/// Rendering (wave 2) consumes [foldChildren] per parent instead of the raw
/// child list; the returned [TreeEntry]s are the ONLY contract it sees, so the
/// shapes here carry everything a folded row needs to paint — label, chip,
/// shared capture spec, member ids and per-member labels — without a second
