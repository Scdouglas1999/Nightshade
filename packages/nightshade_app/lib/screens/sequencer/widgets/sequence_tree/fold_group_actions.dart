// Every mutation a folded row offers (spec §6): move the run as a block,
// duplicate it, disable it, delete it.
//
// Move, duplicate and disable live here; DELETE lives with the single-node
// delete in `delete_node_confirmation.dart`, because the one thing a delete
// has to be consistent about is how it asks.
//
// A separate library rather than a `part` of `sequence_tree.dart` because
// `sequence_tree_context_menu.dart` is its own library and has to reach the
// same operations — the right-click menu on a folded row must not be able to
// drift from the kebab on the same row.
//
// Every entry point shares one shape: `withSequenceMutation` so a locked
// sequence surfaces a snackbar instead of an uncaught throw, and
// `withUndoGroup` INSIDE it so the N `moveNode` / `duplicateNode` /
// `toggleNodeEnabled` calls a group needs collapse into a single undo entry.
// Without the group, undoing a three-member move would take three Ctrl+Z and
// pass through two states the user never asked for.
