// Mosaic Wizard, powered by the planetarium's mosaic planner.
//
// The visual planner draws a grid of camera-FOV-shaped panels over a
// stylised sky background. The user can:
//   * drag the centre of the mosaic to reposition it
//   * use +/- buttons (or the "Advanced" panel) to change the grid
//     dimensions
//   * drag a slider to set rotation; the on-screen grid follows the
//     drag in real time
//   * click any panel to disable / re-enable it (useful when a corner
//     is occluded by trees in the user's view)
//
// The generated `MosaicConfig` shape is identical to the one produced
// by the earlier text-only wizard, so the executor and resume logic
// don't change.
//
// The mosaic-resume banner remains at the top of the dialog — see
// `_buildResumeBanner` below.
