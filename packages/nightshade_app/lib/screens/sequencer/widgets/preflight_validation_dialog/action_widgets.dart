/// The dialog's ONE primary: a [NightshadeButton] on the `start` face.
///
/// It is a real button rather than a hand-rolled box, so the fill, the radius,
/// the disabled dimming, the focus ring and keyboard activation all come from
/// the design system. What stays local is the REFUSAL:
///
///  * the reason travels into the accessible NAME via [GatedAction.announce],
///    because a disabled control whose name reads exactly like the enabled one
///    is indistinguishable from it in a tree dump — the blocked dialog probed
///    as a plain `button: Start sequence` beside its live siblings;
///  * it travels onto the pointer as a tooltip;
///  * and the button's own label node is excluded so the name is published
///    once. Left to merge, the annotation and the visible label concatenate
///    and the node announces itself twice.
