// Mosaic M3 — planner-wiring: persist the wizard's current mosaic design as a
// durable [MosaicProject].
//
// This is the thin glue the brief asks for: it does NOT re-derive any geometry
// (the per-panel centres come from `MosaicService.generatePanels` inside
// [MosaicProjectService.createProject]); it only takes the design the wizard
// already holds — target centre RA/Dec, rows × cols, overlap %, position angle,
// and the per-panel FOV/dims already computed on screen — and hands them to the
// committed M2 service, returning the new `mosaic_projects.id` so the caller can
// route to `/mosaic/:id`.
//
// Splitting this out of the widget keeps the persist contract unit-testable
// without pumping a dialog: a test can drive [MosaicProjectCreationController]
// directly and assert it calls `createProject` with the design's values.
