///
/// These describe triggers the executor installs as siblings of the
/// imaging branch — they run in parallel and fire by hour-angle / sensor
/// state, not by list position. Surfacing them in the preview keeps the
/// user's mental model honest: a meridian flip or a weather-park can
/// interrupt the run at any point, regardless of where the target sits in
