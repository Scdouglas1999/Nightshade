/// Canonical confirmation + delete helper for sequencer nodes.
///
/// Every user-initiated delete path in the sequencer MUST funnel through this
/// file so the confirmation policy stays consistent: it always prompts, even
/// on leaves, and the wording adapts to the count. Without it a misclick can
/// take an entire target subtree silently. A folded run of steps (spec §6) is
/// deleted as a unit through [confirmAndDeleteFoldGroup] below, which is the
/// same policy asked once for the whole run.
///
/// Returns `true` iff the user confirmed AND the underlying remove completed
/// without throwing.
///
/// IMPORTANT: this helper is for USER-INITIATED deletes only. Do not call it
/// from programmatic flows (import dialogs rejecting a node, undo/redo,
/// executor cleanup, …) — those should call
/// [CurrentSequenceNotifier.removeNode] directly so they don't bounce the user
/// through an irrelevant prompt.
