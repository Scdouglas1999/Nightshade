// WHY THIS EXISTS: `Sequence.nodes` includes the implicit root container, a
// node nobody put there and nobody can select or delete. Surfaces that quoted
// `sequence.nodes.length` were therefore off by one against the tree they sat
// next to: a brand-new sequence read "1 node" in the header while the tree
// body under it read "Sequence / 0 steps", and Save as Template offered to
// save "1 nodes" from an empty sequence.
