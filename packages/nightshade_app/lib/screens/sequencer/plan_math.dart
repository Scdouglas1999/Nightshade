// =============================================================================
// plan_math.dart — one walk that answers "what does this subtree actually
// plan to capture?" for every sequencer surface that quotes a frame count or
// an integration time.
// =============================================================================
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the target header card and the library card's preview each
// grew their own recursive walk. Both drifted from the model's own counting
// (`Sequence.totalExposures` / `Sequence._countExposures`) in the same
// direction — they ignored loop multipliers, so a Quick-Start-Wizard sequence
// (`Capture Loop ×10` wrapping one exposure node) was reported as "1 planned
// exposures · 2m" next to a toolbar reading "10 frames" — and the library
// preview ignored SmartExposure entirely, printing "No exposures" for a
// target whose only imager is a Smart Exposure node.
//
// The multiplier rules mirror `Sequence._countExposures` exactly:
//   * a `count` loop multiplies its whole subtree by `repeatCount`;
//   * every other loop kind keeps the single-pass multiplier (so a total is
//     never unbounded) and raises [PlannedCapture.hasUnboundedRepeat] so the
//     caller can say the figure is a per-pass floor rather than the plan;
//   * disabled nodes contribute nothing — they will not run.
//
// A `loopUntilStopped` SmartExposure has no fixed count at all: its per-plan
// counts are ignored by the executor, so its frames are NOT folded into
// [PlannedCapture.frames]; the budget (if any) is reported separately.
