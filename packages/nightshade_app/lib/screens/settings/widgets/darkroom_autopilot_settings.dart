// The dawn Darkroom autopilot — the pass that runs after the masters exist.
//
// This page exists because the feature did not have one. `darkroom.auto_draft`
// was a raw `app_settings` row with no widget and no API, absent-means-on, and
// nothing in Settings mentioned the Darkroom at all: searching "darkroom",
// "draft", "recipe" and "auto draft" each returned "No settings match your
// search", and "dawn" returned only the sequencer's park control. One D1 night
// with that unmentioned default on produced 4 recipes, 4 draft JPEGs, 4
// `.nsrecipe` sidecars, a night report, 9 delivered files and a morning
// notification — none of which the operator had a control for, or was ever told
// about. The nearest switch, "Auto-integrate at end of run", describes only the
// master.
//
// So the whole chain is named here, in the order it runs, with the neighbours
// that can silence each link named too. The switch itself is the only thing
// this page writes.
//
// Each of those neighbours states the value it is actually set to. Describing
// them abstractly left two of the three notes as unanswered questions on the
// one page whose job is to say what will silence tonight's pass: the Delivery
// note never said this rig had exactly one destination, pointed at a folder
// that was not there, and the Notifications note never said whether either
// gate was on.
//
// Remote clients: `darkroom.auto_draft` lives in the LOCAL profile database and
// the pass runs on the machine that integrated the masters. A phone driving a
// remote rig would be editing its own row, which governs nothing, so the page
// says where the setting lives rather than offering a switch for the wrong
// machine — the same stance the Delivery page takes for the same reason.
//
// That refusal reads the client ROLE, not the live connection. A desktop
// launched with `--remote-host` is that rig's client for the whole window
// before its first handshake lands, and again after every drop, and
// `isRemoteModeProvider` reads false through both. Gating on it offered the
// live switch there: one click wrote `darkroom.auto_draft=false` into a
// database no dawn job reads, while the rig it was pointed at kept drafting,
// delivering and notifying at dawn.
