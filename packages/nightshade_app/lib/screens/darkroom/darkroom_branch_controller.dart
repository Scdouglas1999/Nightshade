/// **Why this is a separate notifier.** [DarkroomController] owns one recipe —
/// its step list, its render loop, its journal. A branch bar is about the set of
/// recipes over one master, and A/B compare renders TWO of them at once, each
/// through its own [DarkroomController]. Keeping the set here means the compare
/// pane is an ordinary second family member rather than a second render loop
/// bolted onto the first.
///
/// **Delete is RESTRICT, and the refusal is the product.** [RecipesDao] refuses
/// to delete a recipe that still has branches, because re-parenting them would
/// leave each branch's `divergence_index` pointing into a step list it never
/// diverged from. This notifier turns that refusal into a sentence naming the
/// branches that block it, plus the one destructive alternative the DAO actually
/// offers — deleting the whole line. A "Delete" that silently did nothing, or
/// that quietly deleted the descendants too, are both the cry-wolf defect class.
