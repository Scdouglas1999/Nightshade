/// Drives the Darkroom editor: the recipe as data, the render loop over it, and

///
/// **Where the work happens.** Every Darkroom native call goes through
/// [DarkroomSeam], never through the generated bridge — the UI package must not
/// import it, and a scripted seam is what makes the render loop testable without
/// the Rust library loaded.
///
/// **The render loop.** A render is one synchronous descent into the engine, so
/// it cannot be pre-empted and Dart cannot abort it; it can only be asked to
/// stop. Three mechanisms hold the loop honest:
///
///  * a **debounce** ([kDarkroomRenderDebounce]) so a parameter drag renders
///    once at its end rather than once per frame;
///  * a **single-flight latch** so two renders never enter the engine at once;
///  * a **generation counter** that rides inside the render id, so a superseded
///    render is cancelled by that id and its pixels — which describe a recipe
///    the operator has already changed — are dropped rather than painted.
///
/// The generation moves at the EDIT, ahead of the debounce, because the reply
/// that has to be dropped is the one from a render that is already inside the
/// engine when the edit happens.
///
/// Because the generation is part of the render id, a cancellation flag left
/// armed by a render that finished before it was polled cannot reach into the
/// next render: that one asks under a different id.
