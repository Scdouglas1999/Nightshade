/// A horizontal row of chips that stays REACHABLE when it runs off the edge.
///
/// Both chip rows on this bar — the branches over this master and the links to
/// the night's other masters — are horizontal scrollers rather than `Wrap`s, on
/// purpose: a night with eight masters would otherwise push the image down the
/// screen a row at a time, and this bar sits above the viewport. That choice is
/// only defensible if the chips behind the edge can actually be got at, and in
/// the plain form it shipped as, they could not. Measured at 430x900 with five
/// branches: the last chip laid out at x=494 in a 430-wide window, no scrollbar
/// was drawn, a mouse wheel over the row moved it 0px (Flutter sends wheel
/// deltas along the scrollable's own axis, and a mouse produces vertical ones),
/// and a click-drag was refused outright because `ScrollBehavior.dragDevices`
/// excludes the mouse on every platform. The chips were in the semantics tree
/// and out of reach of the pointer — announced but unusable.
///
/// So one shape, used by both rows, with three ways in:
///
///  * a scrollbar, always visible while there IS an overflow, which is the only
///    thing on screen that says more chips exist and is itself draggable;
///  * a vertical wheel translated onto the horizontal axis, which is what a
///    desktop hand reaches for first — the same translation
///    [AdaptiveTabBar] does for the same reason;
///  * drag with any pointer, mouse included, the way a finger already worked.
///
/// Not a `Wrap` — the offer view uses one for its own copy of this list, and it
/// can afford to: it is a full-width empty state with no viewport under it to
/// push down.
