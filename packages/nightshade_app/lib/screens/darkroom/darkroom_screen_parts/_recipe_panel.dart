/// with nothing to say the rest exists.
///
/// Measured, not guessed: on a 1600x900 desktop with the panel at its 360-pixel
/// default, the alert's message column holds about 28 characters a line and the
/// panel's viewport gives the alert about four of them beneath its heading. So
/// the collapsed account is sized to sit inside that block WITH the control
/// that opens it, rather than to a round number that then runs past the fold
/// again.

/// lines with the control that opens it in the alert's own block.
///
/// Long accounts collapse at a WORD boundary and say so, rather than being
/// sliced wherever the panel's scroll fold happens to fall. The cut is the
/// widget's own and it is marked, so "…" plus a control that names the rest is
/// the difference between text that was shortened and text that looks broken.
///
/// The control lives in the alert's `action` slot rather than under the alert.
/// Under it, the control was a separate row in the panel's scroll view: the
/// alert sat above the fold and the button that completed its sentence sat one
/// line below it, so the operator saw a clause cut off with — as far as the
/// screen was concerned — nothing that said the rest existed. Inside the alert
/// the control cannot be scrolled away from the text it discloses; they share a
/// viewport because they share a box. It costs the message column the button's
/// width, which is less than the row the button used to occupy underneath.
///
/// The disclosure NAMES WHAT IT OPENS. This panel shows more than one of these
/// at once — an autopilot draft over a one-channel master carries both "The
/// draft left 2 operations out" and "The integration recorded 5 calibration
/// warnings" — and measured on the release bundle 2026-08-31 both published
/// `button: 'Show more'`, side by side, with nothing to tell a reader which
/// account each one completes. The word on screen stays "Show more", because it
