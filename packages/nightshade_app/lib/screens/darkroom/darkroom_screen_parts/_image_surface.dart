/// **Why the Darkroom does not use the shared `AstroImageViewer`.** That viewer
/// decodes the buffer it is handed and shows a spinner while it runs. For a
/// gallery that is right — there is nothing else to show. For an editor it is
/// not: every parameter change produces a new buffer, so the picture the
/// operator is judging the change AGAINST disappeared once per render and a
/// slider drag strobed. In blink compare it destroyed the mode outright: each
/// tick showed the other recipe, and between the two frames the eye is supposed
/// to compare there was a blank one for roughly half of every cycle.
///
/// So this surface holds two buffers. [_shown] keeps painting — at the
/// operator's own zoom and pan — while the incoming buffer decodes, and the
/// swap happens on the frame the new image is ready. A small tag says a newer
/// frame is on its way, so "the picture is a moment behind" is stated rather
/// than left to be inferred from a picture that has not changed.
///
/// The transform is the CALLER's: the viewport drives it from its fit / 1:1 /
/// zoom controls, and the compare panes share one so two viewers cannot
/// disagree about where the operator is looking. This surface writes it once,
/// to fit the first frame it decodes, and never again.
