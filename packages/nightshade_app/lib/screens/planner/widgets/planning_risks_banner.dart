/// The planner's risk caveats, as ONE statement of ONE problem.
///
/// The scorer emits a caveat per sensor value it could not resolve, and the
/// banner printed them verbatim, one after another:
///
///   "Camera read noise is not configured; using a conservative 3.5e- planning
///    estimate. Camera full well is not configured; using an 18,000e- planning
///    estimate. Camera QE is not configured; using a 65% planning estimate."
///
/// Three sentences, one problem, and — worse — that problem was usually not
/// real: the values were sitting in the app's own sensor-spec chain, which the
/// planner did not consult. Now they are resolved before the scorer runs, so a
/// sensor caveat only appears for a figure that genuinely misses at every
/// tier. When one does, 02 rule 4 (one banner per problem) and rule 5 (say it
/// once) still apply: the caveats collapse into a single sentence that NAMES
/// the camera, lists the fields, and offers the one action that fixes it.
/// Anything the scorer raises that is not about sensor specs is still said.
