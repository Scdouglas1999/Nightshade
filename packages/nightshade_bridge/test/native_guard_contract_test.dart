/// Contract tests for the `_nativeAvailable` guards on the bridge stub.
///
/// `_nativeBridgeRequired` throws "requires the native bridge", so it is only
/// ever truthful when the native library is ABSENT. An inverted guard makes a
/// method fail on exactly the builds that can serve it, and names a missing
/// bridge as the reason.
///
/// Two spellings put the throw on the bridge-absent path, and both are legal:
///
///   if (!_nativeAvailable) { _nativeBridgeRequired('op'); }
///
///   if (_nativeAvailable) { ...native call...; return; }
///   _nativeBridgeRequired('op');
///
/// The second is the shape the stub standardised on when the Dart fallback
/// device stack was deleted: Rust is the only device path, so every operation
/// is "do it natively or refuse". What is NOT legal is a `_nativeBridgeRequired`
/// sitting INSIDE a positive `if (_nativeAvailable)` block — that refuses on
/// precisely the builds that can serve the call.
///
/// The native branch itself cannot be driven from a unit test: it needs
/// `_nativeAvailable == true`, which needs a `libnightshade_bridge` whose
/// content hash matches the checked-in `frb_generated.dart`, and `flutter test`
/// has no such library on its loader path. So the polarity of every guard is
/// pinned by reading the source.
