/// Type-safe cast helpers for the Dart <-> Rust FFI boundary.
///
/// Per audit-rust §1.4 (`as` casts where `From`/`TryFrom` would be safer),
/// the Rust side has 1,049 unchecked `as` numeric casts. On the Dart side the
/// corresponding risk lives at JSON / dynamic-payload deserialization where
/// `value as Type` will throw a bare `TypeError` if the runtime type does not
/// match.
///
/// These helpers replace `value as T` with a checked cast that throws a
/// structured [CastFailureException] carrying:
///   * the field/context label (so the failure points at the right call site)
///   * the expected type
///   * the actual runtime type and value
///
/// Why a dedicated exception class:
///   - Bare `TypeError` is hard to catch without unsafe `dynamic` typing.
///   - The audit explicitly forbids silent fallbacks (CLAUDE.md "Errors are a
///     feature") — a structured exception preserves stack trace AND context.
///
/// Use [safelyCast] / [safelyCastOpt] at hand-written FFI boundaries where the
/// payload type is not statically proven (PHD2 JSON-RPC responses, ip-api.com
/// payloads, free-form event maps).
///
/// Do NOT use inside FRB-generated files — those are regenerated from Rust and
/// any local edits will be lost.
///
/// Lives in `nightshade_bridge` so the FFI-fallback layer (`bridge_stub.dart`)
/// can use it without depending on `nightshade_core`. The helper is re-exported
/// from `nightshade_core` for discoverability per task spec.
