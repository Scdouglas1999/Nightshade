// Phase 3 Step 1 — Derived tree-index sibling class.
//
// `Sequence` used to carry two `late final` lazy lookup maps
// (`_childrenByParent`, `_parentById`) that were excluded from
// `Equatable.props`. Freezed's generated `==` / `hashCode` would either
// include them (breaking the
// `equality_via_props_uses_nodes_map_and_excludes_derived_indexes` Phase 1
// contract test) or require hoisting them out — this file does the hoist.
//
// `Sequence` now keeps the same `childrenOf` / `parentOf` /
// `descendantsOf` / `invariants` / `countDescendants` API as before; under
// the hood those methods delegate to a `SequenceTreeIndex` cached per
// `Sequence` instance via an [Expando]. The cache is external to the data
// class, so it never participates in equality, hashCode, or copyWith — but
// repeated lookups against the same `Sequence` instance still hit a single
// pre-built index (preserving the W1.7 "O(1) lookup on hot paths"
// performance contract).
//
// Callers that hold a `Sequence` reference get the cached index implicitly
// via the public methods on `Sequence`. Callers that want to be explicit —
// or that need to share an index across several lookups without going
// through `Sequence` — can construct one directly via
// [SequenceTreeIndex.from].
