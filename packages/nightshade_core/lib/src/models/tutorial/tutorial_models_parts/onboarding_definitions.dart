// a modal NightshadeDialog with WHY-style guidance (why polar alignment

// come back. Persisted to `tutorial_progress` so users can resume mid-way.

// Step descriptions are intentionally 80–150 words each — they teach
// WHY each phase exists, not just where to click. A new astrophotographer
// launching Nightshade should be able to finish the wizard and have a
// sequence running without consulting external docs.

        'accurate but slow: it watches a star drift over minutes and tells '
        'you which knob to turn. Plate-solve alignment is fast: it takes '
        'three exposures at different mount angles, solves them, and '
        'computes the polar error directly. Use plate-solve for nightly '
        'setups, drift for permanent piers. Visual observing tolerates 5–10 '
        'arcminutes of error; for imaging aim for under 1 arcminute. The '

        '(power should drop below ~80 %) before you focus, because the '
        'sensor physically shrinks as it cools and your focus point '

        'radius (HFR) of stars at several focuser positions, fits a V-curve '
