// Shared sky <-> screen projection for the framing render path.
//
// This file adds the *inverse* (screen -> RA/Dec) and *forward* (RA/Dec ->
// screen) projection that the Flutter-side HiPS framing tile layer needs, built
// strictly on top of [FramingPlateScale] (`framing_plate_scale.dart`) WITHOUT
// modifying it — other framing components read that file and it must stay a
// minimal value object describing only the fit-to-canvas pixel geometry.
//
// Why a separate helper rather than fields on FramingPlateScale:
//
//  * FramingPlateScale knows the survey image's *angular extent and pixel size*
//    but deliberately does not know the *sky center* (which RA/Dec the canvas
//    center looks at) nor the live pan/zoom/rotation. Those live in the framing
//    provider state. Projection needs both halves, so it is composed here.
//  * The tile layer and the existing canvas must derive byte-identical geometry,
//    so this file also re-exposes the canvas's plate-scale resolution rule
//    ([FramingPlateScale.resolveForCanvas]) as a pure mirror of
//    `FramingCanvas._resolvePlateScale`. The canvas and the tile layer call the
//    same code, guaranteeing the FOV/mosaic overlay stays registered to the
//    HiPS tiles at every zoom.
//
// Conventions (must match the framing render path exactly):
//
//  * The canvas center `(size.width/2, size.height/2)` looks at the target
//    `(centerRaHours, centerDecDegrees)`; pan displaces that center by
//    `(panX, panY)` logical pixels (see `FramingPlateScale.drawRectFor`).
//  * Screen scale is `FramingPlateScale.pixelsPerDegree(size, zoom)` — the one
//    authoritative px/deg every overlay and the survey background use.
//  * Sign convention (from `FramingProvider._recenterFromPan`,
//    `framing_provider.dart:798-818`): dragging the background to the right
//    (+pan x) reveals sky to the *west* so the look-direction (canvas-center)
//    RA *decreases*; dragging down (+pan y) reveals sky to the *north* so the
//    look-direction Dec *increases*. Because +pan x shifts the canvas center to
//    a *lower* RA, screen +x points toward *increasing* RA, and screen +y
//    points toward *decreasing* Dec (north is up). RA offsets scale by
//    `1/cos(dec)` near the poles, mirroring `_recenterFromPan` and
//    `_recalculateMosaicPanels`.
//  * Rotation is applied as `rotate about canvas center` exactly as
//    `FramingSurveyImagePainter.paint` does
//    (`framing_background_painters.dart:67-73`): the unrotated screen point is
//    rotated by `rotation` degrees about the canvas center to get the final
//    on-screen point, and inverted by rotating by `-rotation` for the inverse.
//
// Pure Dart: depends only on `dart:math` and `dart:ui` geometry primitives plus
// the existing [FramingPlateScale]. No Flutter widgets, no Riverpod, no
// provider import — so it is fully unit-testable and shared across the provider,
// the framing painters and the HiPS tile layer without circular dependencies.
