/// Single source of truth for the framing canvas's astrometric scale.
///
/// Historically the framing subsystem carried **three divergent scales**: the
/// survey-image painter ([FramingSurveyImagePainter]) computed a fit-to-canvas
/// draw rectangle, the FOV/reticle overlay assumed a separate "px-per-degree"
/// derived from a hardcoded `60` (one degree == 60px) constant, and the gesture
/// hit-testing math re-derived yet another mapping from pan/zoom. Those three
/// could (and did) drift out of agreement, so a reticle drawn over one part of
/// the sky would not actually correspond to the pixels the survey background
/// occupied there.
///
/// [FramingPlateScale] collapses all of that into one immutable value object.
/// It is constructed from the *known astrometry of the loaded survey image*
/// (its angular field of view, in degrees, and its pixel dimensions) and then
/// answers two questions that every framing painter and gesture handler must
/// agree on:
///
///  * [pixelsPerDegree] — how many on-screen logical pixels span one degree of
///    sky, given the current canvas size and zoom. This replaces the hardcoded
///    `60` and the per-painter re-derivations.
///  * [drawRectFor] — the exact destination rectangle the survey background is
///    drawn into, given canvas size, zoom and pan. Painters and gesture math
///    share this *one* geometry so overlays line up with the imagery to the
///    pixel.
///
/// The fit-to-canvas logic here is intentionally identical to
/// `FramingSurveyImagePainter.paint` (see
/// `packages/nightshade_app/lib/screens/framing/painters/framing_background_painters.dart`):
/// the larger-aspect dimension is pinned to the canvas extent (scaled by zoom)
/// and the other dimension follows from the image aspect ratio. Any change to
/// the painter's draw math must be mirrored here, and vice versa — they are two
/// views of the same geometry and this class is the canonical one.
///
/// Pure Dart: depends only on `dart:ui`'s [Size]/[Rect]/[Offset] geometry
/// primitives, never on Flutter widgets, so it is fully unit-testable and can be
/// shared across providers, painters and gesture handlers.
