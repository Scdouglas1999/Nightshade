/// Unified tolerance configuration for dark-frame matching.

/// This value class is the single source of truth that both

/// UI badges) and `DarkLibraryDao.findBestMatch` (which actually picks the
/// dark to subtract at runtime) must consult. They MUST agree, otherwise the
/// coverage UI can show "all darks present" while the calibration pipeline
/// silently returns null — the IMG-P0-2 audit bug.
///
/// Defaults are tuned for typical astrophotography cameras:
///   * Exposure: ±0.5s catches the request-vs-reported drift seen on real
///     cameras (60.0 vs 60.001 vs 59.999) without falling over to a frame
///     captured at a deliberately different duration.
///   * Temperature: ±1.0°C is the conventional pipeline default — wide
///     enough for typical cooled-camera regulation jitter.
///   * Gain / offset / binning: exact match. These are discrete settings
///     selected by the user; "close enough" is never correct here.
