// What the phone is told when a run stops.
//
// Owner decision 2 (2026-08-14): a stop reaches the phone only when the
// operator did NOT press it — a safety abort, the autopilot's re-plan, a
// subsystem stop — at INFO (non-alarm) priority, carrying the real cause. The
// operator's own press stays silent: they are standing at the keyboard that
// issued it, and a phone that buzzes for every deliberate Stop is the
// cry-wolf shape the whole stop pipeline was cleaned up to remove.
//
// Deciding that needs the EPISODE, not the event. One stop publishes several
// events — the cancel-notice Error, the cancel-notice lifecycle decision, the
// authorship decision, and the terminal `Stopped` pair, the last of which the
// stop API publishes only after the whole safing teardown — and the one that
// names the author can arrive AFTER the ones that do not (the stop API sends
// the executor command before recording its decision, and that send yields).
// So the push waits a short grace for the author before it claims anything,
// and every later member of the same episode is silent: one stop, one push.
