/// One vocabulary for the sequence enum wire tokens.
///
/// A sequence is serialized by two independent codecs: the DB blob in
/// `sequence_nodes.properties` (`sequence_repository/node_encoder` +
/// `node_decoder`) and the sequence FILE format (`sequence_file_service/`,
/// which is also what version snapshots, import/export and the remote
/// `saveFullSequence`/`getFullSequence` carry). Both hand-rolled a converter
/// per enum, and the two sets had already drifted in the fail-silent
/// direction — the same field written with two different tokens, and an
/// unrecognised token decoding to opposite recovery actions.
///
/// Encoding still emits each format's CURRENT bytes: changing them would
/// strand every sequence already on disk. Decoding is one tolerant reader that
/// accepts every historical spelling, so a document written by either side
/// reads back the same on both.
