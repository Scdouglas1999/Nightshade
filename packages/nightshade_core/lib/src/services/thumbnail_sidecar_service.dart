// Sidecar JPEG thumbnail caching for captured FITS frames.
//
// Without caching, every `GET /api/images/{id}/thumbnail` request triggers
// a cold FITS read + stretch + JPEG encode in Rust. Loading a 200-image
// gallery from a phone over a slow link took minutes on Pi-class hardware.
//
// This service generates a `{filePath}.thumb.jpg` next to every newly
// captured FITS (asynchronously via `unawaited(...)` so the capture path
// never blocks) and self-heals legacy rows on demand. Every reader consults
// the sidecar first and only falls back to a fresh decode when the file is
// missing: the remote-mode HTTP handlers via `readSidecar`/`writeSidecarForRow`,
// and the desktop FFI backend via `readSidecar`/`generateAndCacheSidecar`. The
// FFI path used to skip the cache entirely, so on desktop a frame whose sidecar
// was sitting on disk still cost a full-frame FITS decode on every navigation.
//
// Failed sidecar writes are logged at warning severity — not error, because
// the captured image is fully usable without a sidecar and the cold-read
// fallback handles missing ones. Every failure is logged; none is swallowed.
