/// per-panel master, then stitch those masters into one mosaic master.
///
/// This service is the durable spine that ties together pieces that already
/// exist — it deliberately reuses, never reimplements:
///
///  * **Geometry** — the per-panel center RA/Dec come straight from
///    [MosaicService.generatePanels] (the canonical spherical grid math with
///    cos(dec) RA compression + position-angle rotation). The panel dimensions
///    are derived once from the rig FOV (arcmin) and handed to that generator.
///  * **Persistence** — [MosaicProjectsDao] / [MosaicPanelsDao] (raw-DDL v45).
///  * **Per-panel targets** — [TargetsDao]: each panel is a DISTINCT capture
///    target row centered on the panel's RA/Dec, so the subs a panel captures
///    attribute to *that* panel (and [integratePanels] folds exactly that
///    panel's subs, never the whole region's).
///  * **Per-panel integration** — [PostSessionIntegrationService.integrate],
///    which groups a panel's accepted subs by filter into per-filter masters,
///    each carrying its own plate-solved v44 WCS. (Because each panel is a real
///    target, its WCS rides on `integrated_masters` for free — exactly what the
///    stitcher consumes.)
///  * **Stitching** — [PostSessionSeam.stitchMosaic] (the `api_stitch_mosaic`
///    FFI), which projects the panel masters onto a shared gnomonic canvas and
///    feather-blends them into one master.
///
/// [integratePanels] is fail-soft per panel: one bad panel (no subs, an
/// integration throw) is recorded as [MosaicPanelStatus.failed] and the run
/// continues to the next panel, so a single weak panel never sinks the project.
