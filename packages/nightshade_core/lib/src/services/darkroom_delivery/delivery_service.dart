///   journal, and returned in the report. [deliverJobArtifacts] and
///   [sweepDueRetries] do not throw.
/// * **The journal is the only state.** Retries are decided from
///   `delivery_journal` rows — `attempts` and `updated_at` — never from
///   anything held in memory, so a rig that reboots at 04:00 resumes exactly
///   the schedule the dead process was on.
/// * **Nightshade copies, it does not move.** No source file is renamed,
