///
/// Three refusals are deliberate:
///
/// * A manifest that does not verify against this desktop's own token is
///   refused whole. The signature is what binds the checksums to the rig.
/// * A file already on disk under its final name with the manifest's checksum
///   is acknowledged, not re-downloaded.
/// * A download whose bytes do not hash to the manifest's checksum is
///   discarded, never renamed into place, and never acknowledged.
