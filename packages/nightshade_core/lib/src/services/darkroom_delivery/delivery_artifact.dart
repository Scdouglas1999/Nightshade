/// of the bytes ON THE RIG, computed once, so every destination verifies
/// against the same number rather than against whatever it happened to read
/// back.
///
/// Two types, because two callers know different amounts. A fresh job knows
/// which class of artifact each file is and delivers a [DeliveryArtifact]; the
/// overnight retry sweep re-reads a `delivery_journal` row, which records the
/// path but not the class, and delivers a [DeliveryFile]. Transports take the
/// lesser of the two, since the class only ever decides WHICH destinations a
/// file goes to and that decision is already made by the time a transport sees
