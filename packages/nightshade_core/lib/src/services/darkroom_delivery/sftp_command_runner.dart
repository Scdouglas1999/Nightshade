/// The process-invocation seam the SFTP transport drives OpenSSH through.
///
/// Nightshade has no SFTP client dependency — the repository contains no SSH
/// library at all — and hand-rolling SSH cryptography is not on the table. The
/// transport therefore drives the OpenSSH command-line tools the way
/// [PlateSolveService] drives a local solver: `Process.start`, a retained
/// handle so a timeout can actually kill the child, and a typed failure when
/// the binary is absent.
///
/// The seam exists so the transport's decisions — pin the host key, upload to
/// a staged name, verify the remote digest, rename — are unit-testable
/// without an SSH server. The tests substitute a scripted runner; production
/// passes [ProcessSftpCommandRunner].
