/// The rig identity every delivered file name carries.
///
/// Delivery preserves the rig's own file name, and the rig's own file name is
/// not unique across rigs: two installs that image the same night write
/// `job_1_report.json`, `job_1_master_1_draft.jpg` and a `session_L_master_*`
/// per filter, and the job counter on each rig starts at 1. Point both at one
/// NAS share or one SFTP incoming directory and the second rig's file finds the
/// first rig's file already sitting at that name with different bytes. Delivery
/// copies and never overwrites, so the second rig's night is refused with
/// [DeliveryFailureKind.destinationConflict] — terminal, and no later attempt
/// changes it.
///
/// The fix is a rig-identity component on the delivered name:
/// `<rigId>-<the rig's own file name>`.
///
/// **Why a name prefix and not a per-rig subdirectory.** A subdirectory would
/// have to be created, and neither transport is allowed to create one: a
/// watched folder treats a missing directory as an unmounted share precisely so
/// it never fills the boot drive, and the SFTP batch is the exact command set a
/// real sshd validated. A prefix needs no new operation on any transport.
///
/// **Config (`delivery_targets.config_json`).** The optional key `rigId` is the
/// per-destination override:
///
/// ```json
/// {"path": "/mnt/nas/nightshade", "rigId": "shed-rig"}
/// ```
///
///   * absent — the component is this host's name, sanitized. One rig per host
///     is the identity that is true without anybody configuring anything.
///   * a name — that name, sanitized, is the component. This is what two rigs
///     on one host, or a rig whose host name is not what the operator calls it,
///     set.
///   * `""` — no component at all, and delivered names are exactly the rig's
///     own. The opt-out for a single-rig folder whose downstream scripts match
///     on the bare names.
///
/// **What this does to a folder that is already in use.** Nothing already
/// delivered is touched or renamed — delivery copies. Only deliveries made from
/// here on carry the component, so a folder holding both is a folder holding
/// last night's bare names beside tonight's namespaced ones. One consequence is
/// worth naming: a journal row written before this and retried after it looks
/// for the namespaced name, does not find the bare copy it already landed, and
/// delivers a second copy under the new name. That is a duplicate file, never a
/// lost or overwritten one.
