/// Delivery over SFTP to a host the rig can reach — "my Linux box in the
/// office".
///
/// Config (`delivery_targets.config_json`), no key material:
///
/// ```json
/// {"host": "office.local", "port": 22, "user": "sean",
///  "remoteDir": "/srv/astro/incoming",
///  "hostKeyFingerprint": "SHA256:s0m3Base64",
///  "hostKey": "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5...",
///  "digestCommand": "sha256sum"}
/// ```
///
/// The private key lives in `SecretsStore` under the destination row's
/// `secret_ref` and is written to a mode-0600 file inside a private scratch
/// directory for the duration of the delivery.
///
/// **Host key pinning.** On the first delivery the transport scans the
/// server's host keys, pins one of them — both its fingerprint and the key
/// itself — onto the destination row, and writes a known-hosts file for the
/// session. Every later delivery hands that key to OpenSSH as the only one it
/// will accept, so a server presenting anything else is refused by `ssh`
/// itself before a byte moves and reported as
/// [DeliveryFailureKind.hostKeyMismatch]. This is trust on first use — the
/// first connection is the one an attacker would have to already own.
///
/// The pinned key is stored because `ssh-keyscan` is not free. One scan opens
/// SIX unauthenticated connections (measured against OpenSSH 10.5), and an
/// sshd built after 9.8 penalises a source that connects without
/// authenticating: three scans in a row is enough for the server to start
/// dropping the rig's connections outright, corrected credentials and all.
/// Scanning therefore happens once per destination, not once per delivery.
///
/// The session's known-hosts file holds exactly one key and names it under
/// [kSftpHostKeyAlias] rather than under `host:port`, which is what keeps the
/// stored pin free of `ssh-keyscan`'s `[host]:port` formatting.
///
/// **Password authentication is not offered.** OpenSSH deliberately refuses to
/// read a password from a pipe, and the alternative (`sshpass`) is not a
/// dependency of this project. A destination configured for password auth
/// fails with [DeliveryFailureKind.authMethodUnavailable] naming the
/// substitute — a key — rather than appearing to work and hanging on a prompt.
