/// Delivery to another Nightshade install — by publication, not by push.
///
/// The remote protocol serves artifacts by authenticated GET only: there is no
/// peer write scope, no inbound artifact receiver, and no resumable upload.
/// So the rig does not send anything to a peer. It publishes a per-job
/// manifest — the file list with sizes and checksums — and the paired desktop
/// pulls it on schedule or on wake through the existing Range/ETag download
/// surface.
///
/// Publishing is exactly one act: the `delivery_journal` row. That row is the
/// manifest's only source, so a manifest served after a restart lists the same
/// files the process that died had published, and the morning report reads one
/// journal for all three transports.
///
/// Config (`delivery_targets.config_json`):
///
/// ```json
/// {"peerId": "office-pc"}
/// ```
///
/// `peerId` is what the paired desktop identifies itself as when it asks for a
/// manifest. It is required: without it a rig with two peer destinations
/// cannot tell which desktop pulled what, and both would be reported as
/// delivered when one machine collected everything.
