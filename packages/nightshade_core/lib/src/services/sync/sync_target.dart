// Cloud backup/sync — remote storage abstraction.
//
// A [SyncTarget] is a minimal remote filesystem the [SyncService] pushes
// backup bundles to and pulls them from. The contract is intentionally
// tiny (upload / download / list / delete / mkdir) so different remote
// protocols can sit behind it:
//
//   * [WebDavSyncTarget] (webdav_sync_target.dart) — Nextcloud / ownCloud /
//     generic WebDAV.
//   * [S3SyncTarget] (s3_sync_target.dart) — AWS S3 / MinIO / Backblaze B2
//     and any S3-REST-compatible object store, signed with AWS SigV4.
//
// CONFLICT STANCE: sync is bundle-based. Whole backup bundles are uploaded
// and downloaded as opaque files; there is NO merging of remote and local
// state. Restoring a remote bundle replaces local configuration through the
// existing [BackupService.restoreBackup] path, with the same confirmation
// flow a local restore uses.
