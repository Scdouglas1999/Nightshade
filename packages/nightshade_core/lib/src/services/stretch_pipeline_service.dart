/// Renders an on-disk linear FITS into a viewable, auto-stretched PNG.
///
/// This is the FITS -> auto-stretch -> RGBA -> PNG pipeline the Session Review
/// workbench uses to produce a preview for the finishing-artifact FITS files
/// (background-extraction / deconvolution / star-reduction passes write a
/// linear FITS only — no preview). It lives behind [ImagingBackend] so UI code
/// reaches it through the backend role rather than calling the native bridge
/// directly.
///
/// Every step is a native bridge call:
///   1. [bridge.apiReadFitsLinearData] — read the linear FITS for its
///      dimensions (the width/height the PNG must be written at).
///   2. [bridge.apiCalculateAutoStretch] — compute the MAD/STF auto-stretch
///      parameters (the same screen-transfer-function the integration preview
///      uses).
///   3. [bridge.apiApplyStretch] — apply those parameters to produce the 8-bit
///      RGBA display buffer.
///   4. [bridge.apiSaveRgbaPngFile] — write the sibling preview PNG.
///
/// All four calls run on the host that owns the FITS file, so this is a
/// host-local operation; remote (network) backends cannot run it and surface
/// that explicitly rather than guessing.
