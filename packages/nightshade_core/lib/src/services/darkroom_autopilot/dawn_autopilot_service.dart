/// The dawn autopilot: what happens between the last sub of the night and the
/// message that wakes the operator.
///
/// The integration half has already run by the time this starts — masters exist
/// as linear FITS in the library. This service owns the interpretation half:
/// queue a durable job, compose a first-draft recipe for every master, persist
/// it, render the draft the operator wakes up to, write the night report, hand
/// the artifacts to delivery, and send one honest morning message.
///
/// **The job row is the unit of work, not this object.** Every step is bounded
/// by a `darkroom_jobs` row that survives a force quit; the open-time crash
/// recovery re-queues a row a dead process left `running`, and [drainQueue]
/// picks it up on the next start. The inputs are re-derived from the session
/// each time, so a resumed job and a fresh job run the same code.
///
/// **Cancellation is two flags, not one.** A render is a single synchronous FFI
/// descent, so Dart can only ask the engine's loops to stop; [requestCancel]
/// raises the engine's flag AND this service's own, and the second one is what
/// stops the pipeline moving on to the next master after the engine has
/// released the first.
///
/// **Delivery never fails the job.** A destination that is unreachable at 4am
/// is a line in the morning report and a row in the journal; the masters and
/// the draft are already on the rig's own disk.
///
/// **A night report belongs to a pass, not to a job.** The copy handed to
/// delivery is named for the pass that wrote it and is never rewritten, so a
/// re-run after a crash delivers its own report instead of colliding with the
/// previous pass's copy at a shared name. The rig keeps a second copy under the
/// job's own name, and that is the one carrying the delivery and notification
/// outcomes the delivered copy was written too early to hold.
