extension _DeviceServiceProfileConnections on DeviceService {
  /// Parallel "Connect All" with per-device progress.
  ///
  /// Returns a [Stream] of [DeviceConnectProgress] events that the caller
  /// (typically the equipment screen) can subscribe to so each device card
  /// can render its own live status: idle → connecting → connected/failed.
  ///
  /// Why this exists: the equipment screen's previous "Connect All" button
  /// iterated devices sequentially with `await`. Ten devices × 3-5 s each
  /// meant 30-50 s of wall-clock time with no feedback per device. A user
  /// staring at a single spinner has no idea whether the focuser is the
  /// one taking forever or whether the dome failed and the mount succeeded.
  ///
  /// Contract:
  ///
  /// * Every configured device-type from [profile] is connected in parallel
  ///   with `Future.wait`. Device connects do not interact with each other
  ///   during the connect phase (mount/camera/focuser/etc. each go to a
  ///   different driver) so parallelism is safe.
  /// * For each device, the stream emits:
  ///     1. `connecting` immediately as the call is dispatched, and
  ///     2. `connected` if the underlying `connectX` completes, or
  ///        `failed` carrying the raw error if it throws.
  /// * One device failing does NOT block any other device. Per-device
  ///   errors are reported as `failed` events; the stream itself never
  ///   errors and always closes cleanly once every device is settled.
  /// * Errors are a feature: the original backend error is preserved on
  ///   the `failed` event so the UI can show it (driver error, "device not
  ///   reachable", USB hub blip, etc.). We do NOT swallow or rewrite the
  ///   error.
  /// * If [profile] has no configured devices, the stream closes
  ///   immediately with no events.
  ///
  /// The returned stream is single-subscription so initial `connecting`
  /// events are buffered until the caller attaches its listener. UI
  /// surfaces that need to fan out to multiple widgets should feed the
  /// stream through [deviceConnectionProgressProvider]
  /// (see `record(event)`), which materializes the events into a
  /// `ref.watch`-able snapshot that any number of widgets can observe.
