/// this one (the FfiBackend, which is what the headless appliance answers
/// `GET /api/location` with) and the desktop GUI's `GeolocationService`
/// fallback. ip-api.com's free tier answers 403 over HTTPS, so the request was
/// unencrypted by construction. The answer is not advisory — it is written into
/// `observer_latitude`/`observer_longitude`, which drive altitude/airmass,
/// meridian-flip timing and the horizon mask — so anyone on the path could
/// both read the observer's public IP and choose where the rig thinks it is.
///
/// City-centroid databases (ipwho.is, and ipapi.co when it answers) often pin
/// a metro ISP to the city hall. For a US residential IP that is the wrong
/// observatory: Weather, twilight and the horizon mask all follow the pin.

/// remains the TLS fallback when ipinfo refuses or rate-limits.
///
/// The second rule here is that an unusable answer is an error, never a
/// coordinate. Defaulting a missing `lat`/`lon` to `0.0` puts the rig on Null
