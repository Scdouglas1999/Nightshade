// Pillar C ("Constellation") — client-side orchestration over a hub.
//
// [ConstellationClient] is the raw REST surface (one endpoint per method);
// [ConstellationService] is the workflow on top of it that the app and the
// providers drive:
//
//   * sign in / register an account against a self-hosted hub,
//   * browse the shared targets the swarm is collecting,
//   * JOIN a shared target (records the chosen hub target locally),
//   * CONTRIBUTE the local atlas tiles for that target — by default the
//     *additive sums* (the serialized `.nst` keystone bytes the
//     [SkyAtlasService] exports), never raw subs, so nothing on the user's disk
//     leaves the device except the same accumulator the master integration
//     already keeps,
//   * PULL the fused community co-add back down and cache it under the atlas
//     `swarm/` directory so the UI can blend it into "Your Sky",
//   * follow-the-night: ask the hub which shared targets are dark for this user
//     right now and turn them into deepen-the-thinnest suggestions, claiming/
//     releasing the handoff baton so the swarm does not double-collect the same
//     sky. These currently surface only on the Constellation screen's
//     follow-the-night card, not yet in the planner/scheduler tabs.
//
// The service holds no global mutable state beyond the small in-memory swarm
// cache (an index of pulled tiles); persistence of the contribution log is
// deferred to the dedicated Drift table when that lands. Privacy default: SUMS.
