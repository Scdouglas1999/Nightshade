// Collaborative Sky (6.0) WS2 / WS4 — the persisted consent that gates a mosaic
// panel-master upload.
//
// A panel master is FULL-RESOLUTION integrated data — at least as revealing as
// the raw subframes the Constellation contribute flow gates with its strongest
// consent. So a panel master must NEVER leave the device under a silent
// hardcoded license: the user has to pick a sharing license + an attribution
// (anonymity) preference, and explicitly opt in, exactly like
// `constellation_contribute_sheet.dart`.
//
// The interactive UI presents that choice and persists it here; an UNATTENDED
// rig (the [CollaborativeMosaicPoller] auto-uploading on a "nobody watching"
// night, or the headless REST upload endpoint) has no sheet to present, so it
// reads this PERSISTED record instead. A missing record means the user has not
// consented and the upload is refused — fail closed, never a default ccBy.
