// Collaborative Sky (6.0) WS2 — the unattended-rig auto-driver for distributed
// collaborative mosaics.
//
// The hub auto-flips a mosaic to `assembling` the moment the final panel master
// lands, and to `complete` once the owner pushes the stitched output. But those
// two terminal steps still require the local rig to ACT: the owner must pull
// every panel + run the native stitch + push the result; a participant must pull
// the finished mosaic. On a manned session a human taps the buttons on the
// mosaic project screen — but a real unattended collaborative night (the 6.0
// demo: four rigs across three cities, owner asleep) needs the OWNER rig to
// complete the mosaic with nobody watching.
//
// [CollaborativeMosaicPoller] is that driver. It periodically sweeps this
// device's in-flight collaborative projects and, per role:
//
//   * EITHER ROLE — auto-uploads this rig's integrated-but-unuploaded panels
//     it holds the claim baton for, via
//     [CollaborativeMosaicService.uploadPanelMaster]. This is the integrate→
//     upload bridge that actually moves a captured panel into the hub: without
//     it a truly unattended rig would integrate its panel locally but never
//     push it, the hub would never reach `assembling`, and the auto-assembly
//     below would never fire. The upload only runs when the user has recorded
//     an UNATTENDED-UPLOAD consent (license + attribution + auto-upload opt-in);
//     with no such consent the rig leaves uploads manual rather than shipping
//     full-resolution pixels under a silent default (the WS4 consent contract).
//   * OWNER  — refreshes the hub status; when the hub reports `assembling`
//     (every panel uploaded) it runs [CollaborativeMosaicService.assembleMosaic]
//     EXACTLY ONCE (pull + stitch + push), completing the mosaic.
//   * PARTICIPANT — refreshes the hub status; when the hub reports `complete`
//     it runs [CollaborativeMosaicService.downloadOutput] once, pulling the
//     finished mosaic the owner published back to the swarm.
//
// Re-entrancy is the only real hazard: a native stitch spans minutes, so a naive
// timer would fire `assembleMosaic` again on the next tick while the first is
// still running (and again, and again). The poller guards with a per-project
// in-flight set AND a whole-sweep guard, and leans on `assembleMosaic`'s own
// hub-status==assembling re-check + abort-on-unpullable-panel so it can never
// publish an incomplete mosaic even if a force-release reverts the mosaic to
// `open` mid-flight.
