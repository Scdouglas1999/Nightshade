// Collaborative Sky (6.0) WS2 — client-side orchestration for distributed
// collaborative mosaics.
//
// [ConstellationClient] is the raw REST surface (publish / claim / upload /
// download / assemble endpoints); this service is the workflow on top of it that
// the controller + headless seam drive:
//
//   * PUBLISH a durable MosaicProject's panel grid to the hub so its panels
//     become claimable distributed work items (persists hub_mosaic_id +
//     collab_role=owner),
//   * CLAIM panels with the hand-off baton (persists the claim token +
//     assigned account/rig provenance on each panel),
//   * UPLOAD a claimed panel's locally-integrated master FITS to the hub (only
//     a WCS-bearing, plate-solved master — an un-solved panel would be silently
//     dropped by the stitch >= 2-WCS-panel gate),
//   * ASSEMBLE (owner-only): pull every panel master the swarm uploaded, run the
//     EXISTING [MosaicProjectService.stitchProject] (the only real stitcher —
//     the pure-Dart hub cannot run the native gnomonic feather-blend), and push
//     the finished mosaic back so the hub serves it to every participant.
//
// Construction mirrors [ConstellationService]: a credentials resolver + an
// injectable client factory (so it is exercised with a `package:http/testing`
// MockClient) + a logger, kept DB-agnostic via resolvers.
