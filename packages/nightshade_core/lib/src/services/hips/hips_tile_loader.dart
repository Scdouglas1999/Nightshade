// Component C6 — HiPS framing tile loader / orchestrator.
//
// This is the *scheduler* that turns a stream of fast-changing framing
// viewports (pan/zoom/rotate gestures, target switches) into a small, ordered,
// non-thrashing set of decoded tiles for the framing painter to composite — and
// the [ChangeNotifier] the painter listens to for "the resident tile set
// changed, repaint".
//
// It sits squarely between the pure-geometry brain (C3 [HipsTileSelection]),
// the residency policy (C4 [HipsTileCache]) and the network/decode edge (C5
// [HipsTileFetcher]). It owns none of their jobs; it *sequences* them so the
// framing background streams in smoothly without ever blocking the UI thread,
// re-fetching on every gesture delta, or flashing blank.
//
// ## What it guarantees (the anti-jank contract, by item)
//
//  1. **Off-UI-thread fetch + decode.** Every fetch/decode goes through C5,
//     whose `instantiateImageCodec` work runs on the engine's IO/raster worker
//     threads. C6 only `await`s those futures and inserts the finished
//     [ui.Image] into the C4 cache; it performs no per-pixel CPU work and never
//     blocks a frame. The painter reads a pre-built immutable [snapshot] and
//     paints — it never awaits the loader.
//
//  2. **Bounded LRU cache.** All decoded tiles live in the injected
//     [HipsTileCache] (C4), which evicts by entry-count and byte-budget. C6
//     never holds a decoded image outside the cache (except the transient local
//     in a fetch continuation, which is handed to the cache or disposed in the
//     same synchronous step).
//
//  3. **Debounce + dedup + cancel.** [requestTiles] coalesces a burst of
//     viewport updates into one trailing recompute via an injectable
//     [HipsLoaderClock] (so tests drive it deterministically with no real
//     delay). In-flight fetches are de-duplicated by [HipsTileId] through a
//     shared-[Future] map: two viewports that both need the same tile share one
//     network request. Each recompute opens a new *generation* with its own C5
//     [HipsFetchToken]; when a newer viewport supersedes it, the old
//     generation's token is cancelled so its in-flight requests abort promptly
//     instead of thrashing the socket pool and landing stale tiles in the cache.
//
//  4. **Level-of-detail with a never-blank fallback.** Each recompute selects
//     the [HipsTileSelection.selectNorder] for the current scale and requests
//     those tiles, but it *also* immediately exposes whatever coarser imagery is
//     already resident — the survey [HipsTileId] of each tile's parent
//     (`ipix >> 2`, one order up) and the Allsky thumbnail — through the
//     [snapshot], so the painter always has *something* to draw under the
//     streaming high-order tiles. The loader fetches the Allsky map first (the
//     instantly-available whole-sky coarse LOD) and pre-fetches parents so a
//     freshly-zoomed region is covered by a coarse tile within one round-trip.
//
//  5. **Seam-free mosaicing** is C3's job (shared HEALPix boundary sky points);
//     C6 preserves it by requesting the exact tile-id set C3 returns and never
//     substituting a different tessellation.
//
//  6. **GPU compositing** is the painter's job; C6 only delivers [ui.Image]s.
//
//  7. **Registration to the FOV/mosaic overlay** is guaranteed by routing every
//     viewport through the *same* [FramingPlateScale]/[FramingSkyProjection] C3
//     and the framing overlays use; C6 passes the viewport straight through to
//     [HipsTileSelection.computeVisibleTiles] without re-deriving any geometry.
//
// ## Errors are a feature
//
// A fetch failure is surfaced, not swallowed: failed tiles are recorded in the
// snapshot's [HipsResidentSnapshot.failures] and re-thrown to an injected
// [HipsTileLoaderErrorSink] (defaulting to `dart:developer` logging) so a
// developer/operator sees them, while the never-blank coarse fallback keeps the
// view usable. A *cancellation* ([HipsFetchCancelledException]) is the expected
// outcome of a superseded generation and is dropped quietly — it is not an error
// the user should see.
//
// Pure Dart + `dart:ui` + `dart:async`: no Flutter widget layer, no Riverpod, no
// direct `dart:io`. Fully unit-testable with a fake clock, a `MockClient`-backed
// C5 fetcher, and a real C4 cache.
