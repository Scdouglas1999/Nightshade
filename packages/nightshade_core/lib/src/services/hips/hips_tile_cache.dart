/// Component C4 — bounded LRU cache of decoded HiPS image tiles.
///
/// The framing tile layer paints decoded [ui.Image] tiles directly into the
/// framing canvas (see `FramingSurveyImagePainter`). Decoded RGBA images are
/// large and GPU-backed, so an unbounded map of them would balloon native
/// memory and starve the engine's own raster cache. This cache keeps the set
/// of resident tiles bounded by **two independent limits** — a maximum entry
/// count and an approximate decoded-byte budget — and evicts the
/// least-recently-used tiles, disposing their [ui.Image] handles, whenever
/// inserting a new tile would exceed either limit.
///
/// ## Why both an entry cap and a byte budget
/// HiPS tiles are uniform per survey (typically 512x512), but a cache shared
/// across surveys, Allsky thumbnails, and mixed tile widths sees a wide range
/// of decoded sizes. An entry-count cap alone cannot bound memory when tiles
/// are large; a byte budget alone cannot bound the bookkeeping/atlas churn
/// when tiles are tiny. Enforcing both keeps memory *and* draw-call counts in
/// hand regardless of the survey's tile geometry.
///
/// ## LRU semantics
/// Recency is tracked by insertion order in a [LinkedHashMap]: the first key
/// is the least-recently-used, the last is the most-recently-used. Every
/// [get] that hits, and every [put], moves the entry to the
/// most-recently-used end ("touch on access"). Eviction always removes from
/// the LRU end until both limits are satisfied.
///
/// ## Ownership of [ui.Image]
/// A [ui.Image] is a disposable native resource. This cache **takes ownership**
/// of every image handed to [put]: when an entry is evicted, replaced, or the
/// cache is [clear]ed/[dispose]d, the cache calls [ui.Image.dispose] on the
/// image it dropped. Callers that paint a cached image hold a borrowed
/// reference that is valid only until the image is evicted, so painters must
/// read images through a [snapshot] taken at the start of a frame and never
/// retain a cached [ui.Image] across frames. Because a fresh snapshot is taken
/// each frame and eviction only happens on [put]/[clear]/[dispose] (never
/// concurrently mid-paint on Dart's single isolate), an image referenced by a
/// live snapshot cannot be disposed out from under the painter within that
/// frame.
///
/// This type is **pure Dart + `dart:ui`** — it has no dependency on the Flutter
/// widget layer and performs no I/O or decoding itself; it is solely the
/// residency/eviction policy over already-decoded tiles produced by the
/// fetch/decode pipeline.
