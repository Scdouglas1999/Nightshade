// Component C5 — HiPS HTTP fetch + async (off-UI-thread) decode client.
//
// This is the *network + decode edge* of the Flutter-side GPU HiPS framing tile
// layer. It is the only HiPS component that touches the wire: every other
// component (C0 metadata/addressing, C1 HEALPix, C2 projection, C3 selection,
// C4 cache) is pure CPU geometry/bookkeeping. C5 turns a tile address (C0
// [HipsTileId]) or a survey base URL into either parsed [HipsProperties] or a
// decoded [ui.Image] ready to hand to the C4 cache and the framing painter.
//
// What it does, exactly:
//
//   * [fetchProperties] — GETs the survey `properties` text document and parses
//     it via [HipsProperties.parse]. A non-200 status, an empty body, a body
//     that is not valid UTF-8, or a malformed properties document all throw —
//     never a silently defaulted/guessed [HipsProperties].
//   * [fetchAllsky] — GETs `Norder{k}/Allsky.{ext}` (the coarse whole-sky
//     thumbnail used as the never-blank lowest level-of-detail) and decodes it
//     off the UI thread to a [ui.Image].
//   * [fetchTile] — GETs `Norder{k}/Dir{d}/Npix{n}.{ext}` for a single
//     [HipsTileId] and decodes it off the UI thread to a [ui.Image].
//
// Anti-jank guarantees this component is responsible for:
//
//   * **Decode is off the UI/build thread.** Decoding uses
//     [ui.instantiateImageCodec], whose work (parsing the compressed bytes and
//     rasterising to GPU-uploadable pixels) runs on the engine's IO/raster
//     worker threads, not the Dart UI isolate. The `await`s here only suspend
//     the calling async frame; they never busy-spin the UI thread. This is the
//     same engine path the existing single-cutout survey background uses
//     (`ui.decodeImageFromList` in `FramingProvider`), so tile imagery
//     composites identically. We use the lower-level codec API rather than the
//     `decodeImageFromList` convenience wrapper because it (a) lets us surface a
//     decode failure as a thrown error instead of the wrapper's silent
//     null-frame behaviour, and (b) gives us a [ui.Codec] we explicitly dispose.
//   * **Cancelable.** Every fetch takes an optional [HipsFetchToken]; cancelling
//     it aborts the in-flight request (closing the underlying HTTP client used
//     for that request) and makes the pending future complete with a thrown
// [HipsFetchCancelledException]. The tile-request scheduler cancels
//     superseded requests during pan/zoom so stale tiles never thrash the
//     network or land in the cache after the view moved on. A decoded image
//     produced by a request that lost the cancellation race is disposed here so
//     it never leaks.
//
// What it deliberately does **not** do (kept out of C5 by contract):
//
//   * No caching, no in-flight de-duplication, no LRU — that is C4 (the cache)
//     and C6 (the scheduler/debouncer). C5 is a stateless-per-call edge: each
//     method does exactly one fetch+decode and returns.
//   * No base-URL resolution or survey registry lookup — callers pass the
//     already-resolved `baseUrl` (verified via [HipsSurveyRegistry] or resolved
//     at runtime). C5 never fabricates a host.
//   * No Riverpod, no Flutter widget layer. Pure Dart + `dart:ui` + `dart:io`
//     timeout + `package:http`, fully unit-testable with `package:http/testing`
//     [MockClient].
//
// No silent fallbacks: a network failure, a non-200 status, an empty or
// oversized body, an undecodable image, and a malformed properties document
// each throw a typed exception the caller must handle. A blank or wrong tile
// painted without a word is the failure this prevents.
