// Where the scheduler's own diagnostics go.
//
// `dart:developer` alone has NO destination in a shipping Flutter build that
// the operator (or an auditor) can reach:
//
//   * the rolling `nightshade.log.<date>` on disk is written by the Rust
//     tracing appender and carried 0 SchedulerEngine lines, and
//   * Settings > Advanced > Logs reads LoggingService's in-memory ring, which
//     `dart:developer` never feeds — its source dropdown offered only
//     `SequenceExecutor`.
//
// A `dart:developer`-only reconcile line — the one piece of evidence that says
// WHICH engine instance re-armed the autopilot — is therefore uncheckable after
// the fact.
//
// The engine keeps writing to `dart:developer` (useful under a debugger) and
// ALSO writes to an injectable [SchedulerLogSink]. The Riverpod wiring binds
// that sink to [LoggingService], which puts scheduler diagnostics into the
// in-app Logs viewer, `/api/logs/recent` + `/api/logs/tail`, and the on-disk
// diagnostic export (`LoggingService.exportLogs` appends the in-memory Dart
// entries after the native files).
