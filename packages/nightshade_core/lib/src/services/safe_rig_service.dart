/// missing capability: pause the running sequence (preserving its
/// checkpoint), park the mount so it stops tracking into the ground/clouds,
/// and optionally close the dome shutter and cover. Before this service the
/// weather path *computed* the actions but never executed them, and the
/// low-disk watchdog only paused (leaving the mount tracking with the night
/// dead and unattended). Centralising the action means there is one
/// fail-closed, loudly-erroring implementation instead of three divergent
/// half-implementations.
///
/// Ordering rationale:
///   1. Pause the sequence FIRST so no new exposure / slew is issued while we
///      park (best-effort: if there is no running sequence, this is a no-op).
///   2. Park the mount — the safety-critical step. Stops tracking; on most
///      mounts also slews to a safe stow position.
///   3. Close the dome shutter, then the cover — physical weather protection.
///
/// Every requested step is attempted even if an earlier one throws; the
/// aggregated failures are surfaced via a CRITICAL notification and a thrown
/// [SafeRigException]. Device ids are resolved from the live equipment state
/// providers exactly as [_autoResumeAfterWeatherClear] resolves the mount.
