/// a backup script, `sqlite3 nightshade.db`, a support engineer counting
/// frames — therefore parks a lock across the daemon's writes.
///
/// With the sqlite3 default of zero, the first such write fails instantly:
/// `beforeOpen` runs writes, so the daemon dies at startup, and a Darkroom job
/// write fails mid-pass and strands the row in `running`. Five seconds covers
/// the read transactions those tools actually hold (milliseconds to a second)
/// while staying far below any timeout an operator would read as a hang, and
/// it is the value SQLite's own documentation recommends for multi-process
/// access. It is a ceiling, not a delay: an uncontended write returns at once.
