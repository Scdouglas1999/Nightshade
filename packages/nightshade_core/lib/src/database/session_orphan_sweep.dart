/// The one honest close for an `imaging_sessions` row left `active` by a
/// process that is no longer driving it.
///
/// **Why one rule shared by two callers.** The row is closed from two places
/// and they must not drift: the boot sweep in `beforeOpen`, which runs before
/// anything in the process can open a session, and [SessionService] at
/// sequence start, which runs it when this process holds no live session of
/// its own. Both are answering the same question — "this row says a night is
/// in progress and no executor is driving it; what is true?" — so both write
/// the same status, the same end time and the same note.
///
/// **What went wrong without it.** `SessionsDao.startSession` refuses to open a
/// second row while an older one is `active`, and every caller of that method
/// treats the refusal as "no session row". A daemon stopped mid-run (a cloud
/// call at 2am, the updater, a power blip) therefore left row N `active`
/// forever, and from the next launch onward EVERY frame of EVERY night
/// registered with `session_id` NULL: the session-end hooks that key on the
/// session id — post-session integration, the dawn Darkroom pass — never fired,
/// no masters and no drafts were made, and `GET /api/sessions/active` kept
/// serving the dead run's frozen counters while a live run captured.
///
/// **The frames already stranded are left where they are.** A database that ran
/// the old code carries `captured_images` rows with `session_id` NULL, and the
/// sweep does not adopt them. It cannot: while row N stood open every later
/// night's frames landed NULL, so the only clue to which night a stranded frame
/// belongs is its `captured_at` — and the abandoned session's window covers all
/// of them, which would file three separate nights under the one row that was
/// stuck. Attaching by proximity would turn a visible gap into a confident
/// wrong answer, and every per-night figure built on it (integration time,
/// efficiency, the History card) would inherit the guess.
///
/// They stay reachable rather than lost: `ImagesDao.watchStandaloneImages` —
/// what Analytics' Session tab lists as sessionless captures, alongside single
/// frames taken outside any sequence — reads exactly this set, and each row
/// keeps its file path, target, filter and timestamp. What they cannot do is
/// re-enter a session-keyed pass; an operator who wants masters from such a
/// night integrates those frames by hand. From this sweep forward the set stops
/// growing, which is the half that was actually in reach.
