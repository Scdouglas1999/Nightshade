  /// all, and the ones a "Draft for me" produced were erased by the first
  /// Reload. A mono master's four-step stack silently dropped the colour
  /// calibration, and nothing in the editor said why.

  /// The payload is a JSON array of `{opId, outcome, reason}` objects — the

  /// describes the composition in both places. See [RecipeDraftNote].

  /// Purely additive: one guarded `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` with a `'[]'`

  /// account rather than as one whose account is unreadable. The guard is
  /// [_columnExists] because fresh installs get the column from
  /// `_createDarkroomTables`.
