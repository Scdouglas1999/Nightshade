  ///   * New `living_sky_retention` table — per-scope "where did the last
  ///     prune get to" markers (transient age-out, cutout/delta cache sweep,
  ///     swarm-blob sweep) so a maintenance pass is incremental instead of
  ///     re-scanning all history.
  ///   * INDEXES that turn the documented full-scans into seeks:
  ///       - `idx_transient_detections_dismissed (dismissed, tile_id)` — the
  ///         per-frame dismissed-suppression lookup, now scoped to the covered
  ///         tiles instead of scanning the whole all-time dismissed set.
  ///       - `idx_transient_detections_confirmed (reviewed, dismissed, detected_at)`
  ///         — the `reviewed && !dismissed` Confirmed feed, newest-first.
  ///       - `idx_sky_tiles_dec (center_dec_deg)` — the Dec-band cone prefilter
  ///         backing Contribute / Pull / Your-Sky cone selection at scale.
  ///       - `idx_sky_atlas_folds_contributor (contributor, tile_id, healpix_order)`
  ///         — export-delta excluding foreign (swarm) folds without scanning a
  ///         tile's whole fold history.
  ///
  /// Guarded by [_tableExists] to match the v52–v54 style (the v2–v17 chain
  /// recreates tables from the CURRENT Drift schema, which already declares
  /// these, so a blind `createTable` would throw on those paths). The indexes
  /// are created with `IF NOT EXISTS` here AND are re-asserted by
  /// `_createCustomIndexes` (re-run by the migration strategy after this hook),
  /// so creating them in either place is idempotent. The new table's unique
  /// `@TableIndex` on `scope` is materialized explicitly below for the same
  /// reason as v54's contribution-key index (createTable does not always emit
  /// the table index on the migration path).
