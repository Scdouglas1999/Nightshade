  /// on the measured value rather than re-deriving it from PSF tiles.
  ///
  /// Like `eccentricity`, `fwhm` is a raw-DDL column (not declared on the
  /// Drift [CapturedImages] table), so it is retrofitted with a guarded
  /// `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`. The add is guarded by [_columnExists]
  /// because fresh installs add the same column in
  /// `_ensureCapturedImagesProducingNodeColumns`, and the v2–v17 chain can
  /// recreate `captured_images` mid-upgrade.
