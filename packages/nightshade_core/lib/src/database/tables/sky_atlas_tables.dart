/// Pillar A ("Your Sky") persistence — the personal sky atlas.
///
/// The atlas folds every plate-solved light frame into a fixed HEALPix tiling
/// (NESTED, order [skyAtlasHealpixOrder]) so the same patch of sky accumulates
/// across nights and equipment changes. Three tables back the feature:
///
///   * [SkyTiles] — one row per materialized HEALPix tile, carrying the running
///     totals and a pointer to the on-disk `.nst` streaming accumulator sidecar.
///   * [SkyAtlasRegions] — named, human-facing groupings of tiles (a target, a
///     mosaic, a custom box) used to drive the atlas browser and per-region
///     coverage rollups.
///   * [SkyAtlasFolds] — the append-only fold timeline that makes "scrub a
///     region across time" possible: each row records one fold of one tile at a
///     point in time, with the frames/weight/integration it added and the
///     session that contributed it.
///
/// Enum-ish columns ([SkyAtlasRegions.kind]) are stored as stable text so a
/// forward-compatible reader degrades gracefully, matching the convention in
/// `tables/narrator_events.dart`. FK columns are nullable where the referenced
/// row can legitimately disappear (a deleted session or target), so atlas
/// history survives the deletion of the thing that produced it.

/// HEALPix order the atlas tiling is built at. Must match
/// `sky_atlas.rs::ATLAS_HEALPIX_ORDER` (9) — see the constants table in
/// `docs/nightshade_5_0_contracts.md`. Persisted per-row on tiles/folds so a
/// future order change can be detected rather than silently mis-addressing
/// historical tiles.
