/// Pillar B ("First Light") persistence — the difference-imaging transient log.
///
/// Every fresh, plate-solved light frame is differenced against the deep atlas
/// template for the tiles it covers (`api_difference_image`). Each residual
/// source that survives the photometric subtraction is one row here: where it
/// is on the sky, how bright the change was, its shape, and — the headline —
/// whether the Dart cross-match could put a name to it. A null [catalogMatch]
/// on a clean point source is the genuinely exciting case: a possible new
/// transient.
///
/// Nullable-reference convention matches the science tables
/// (`tables/science.dart`): both [sessionId] and [capturedImageId] are nullable
/// so a sessionless or already-deleted-frame detection survives as history. The
/// shape-class [kind] is stored as its stable wire string
/// (`pointBrightening` | `movingStreak` | `dipole` | `newSource`) so a
/// forward-compatible reader degrades gracefully, matching the constants table
/// in `docs/nightshade_5_0_contracts.md`.
