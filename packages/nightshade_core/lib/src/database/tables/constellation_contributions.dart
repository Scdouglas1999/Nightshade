/// Pillar C ("Constellation") persistence — per-(hub, tile) federation receipts.
///
/// The swarm shares one storage substrate and one solve hook with Pillars A/B,
/// which is exactly why an unguarded "contribute"/"pull" loop silently corrupts
/// the shared community co-add. This table is the durable receipt that makes the
/// federation idempotent and honest:
///
///   * CONTRIBUTION side — a per-tile high-water mark so re-contributing the
///     same field ships only the new night (true delta) instead of the whole
///     accumulator from epoch. The persisted [contributionId] is the remote
///     receipt id that also unblocks the privacy "Retract" action.
///   * PULL side — a per-tile high-water of the community depth last pulled, so
///     re-pulling a tile with no new community frames is a cheap no-op instead
///     of re-folding the entire community stack into the local overlay every
///     press.
///   * JOIN side — the joined-target rehydration row so a remote companion (or a
///     relaunched host) can re-render the user's federation state without a live
///     hub round-trip.
///
/// Identity is `(hubKey, tileId, healpixOrder)` — one receipt per tile per hub.
/// [hubKey] is the federation endpoint identity (a normalized hub base URL); the
/// service normalizes scheme+host+port before using it so a cosmetic URL change
/// (http/https, trailing slash, mDNS vs IP) does not orphan receipts.
///
/// Enum-ish/text columns are stored as stable text to match the convention in
/// `tables/sky_atlas_tables.dart` / `tables/narrator_events.dart`. This table is
/// intentionally additive and never references the atlas tables by FK: a deleted
/// or re-folded tile must not cascade-drop a federation receipt that still has a
/// live remote `contributionId`.
