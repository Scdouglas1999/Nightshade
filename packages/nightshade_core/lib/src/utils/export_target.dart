/// does not override `getSavePath`, so the platform interface's base method
/// throws `UnimplementedError: getSavePath() has not been implemented.` Every
/// call site that asked for a save location was therefore dead on a phone:
/// exporting a sequence, a diagnostics dump, a finder chart, an equipment
/// profile or a backup produced only that error text. Observed on an API 35
/// emulator: "Failed to export: UnimplementedError: getSavePath() has not been
/// implemented."
///
/// So on touch platforms this picks a path under the app documents directory
/// and reports [ExportTarget.needsShareSheet] so the caller finishes the job
/// with the share sheet — the same route the working exports already take.
///
/// Returns null only when the user cancels the desktop dialog; the touch path
/// never cancels.
