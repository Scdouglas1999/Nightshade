/// WHY THIS EXISTS: the Continue Session dialog formatted integration as
/// whole minutes ("0 minutes" for a 12-second session, "2 minutes" for 90
/// seconds) while the dashboard's last-run card rendered the same run as
/// "12s". Reporting real captured photons as "0 minutes" reads as "the run
/// did nothing". One formatter, so the two surfaces cannot disagree.
///
/// Wave C2 folded ~30 private `_formatDuration` copies in here. They were not
/// one function: four distinct output shapes existed side by side, so
/// [DurationFormat] is parameterised by [DurationStyle] instead of picking a
/// winner and silently restyling half the app.
///
/// THE ONE DELIBERATE BEHAVIOUR CHANGE (GUI finding SEQ-20): every copy that
/// rendered only whole minutes printed **"0m"** for a sub-minute duration — the
/// builder's target card read "4 planned exposures • 0m" next to a "~20s"
/// estimate for the same node. All four styles here render seconds below one
/// minute, so "0m" is unreachable. Above one minute those sites are unchanged.
