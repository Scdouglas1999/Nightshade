///
/// `DeviceService.connectAllFromProfile` emits a [DeviceConnectProgress]
/// for every device in the sweep. This provider materializes those events
/// into a `Map<deviceType, DeviceConnectProgress>` snapshot so UI widgets
/// (per-device chips, banners, etc.) can `ref.watch` the current status of
/// any single device-type without having to subscribe to the stream
/// themselves.
///
/// Lifecycle:
/// * `startSweep()` clears any prior snapshot and marks the sweep as
///   in-flight so the UI can hide stale entries from previous runs.
/// * `record(event)` is called by the caller for every stream event;
///   the latest event per device-type overwrites the prior one (so
///   `connecting → connected` updates the same map slot in place).
/// * `endSweep()` flips `isSweeping` to `false` while preserving the
///   per-device final state so the UI can still render the result.
/// * `clear()` resets the provider for a fresh run.
