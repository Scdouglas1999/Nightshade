/// Time-source abstraction for Nightshade.

/// Why: a remote observatory operator may live in one time zone while the
/// rig sits in another. The Settings → Location → Timezone dropdown and
/// "Use system time" toggle let the operator override the host's clock so
/// session timestamps, sequencer cadences, and diagnostic dumps reflect
/// the **observatory's** local time, not the laptop's. The two relevant
/// use cases the toggle was built for:
///
///   1. **Remote-observatory** — A hosted scope at a remote site emits
///      logs in the site's local time even when the controlling laptop
///      sits elsewhere. The operator picks the site's IANA TZ and toggles
///      "Use system time" off.
///   2. **Travelers** — An astrophotographer flies a scope to a star
///      party in a different state. Their laptop's TZ is correct but the
///      saved sequences/profiles were authored in their home TZ; setting
///      "Use system time" on uses the new local time automatically.
///
/// `Clock.now()` returns whichever wall-clock the user asked for; call
/// sites that need a stable monotonic clock should still use
/// `DateTime.now()` directly (the system clock is not what the user
/// chose — it is what the OS scheduler counts on).

  /// This is a rendering, not an instant. Dart has no arbitrary-offset
  /// `DateTime`, so [FixedOffsetClock] returns the shifted fields tagged
  /// `isUtc: false`; the host then treats them as its own local time.
  /// `now().toUtc()`, `now().millisecondsSinceEpoch` and
  /// `now().difference(someRealTimestamp)` are therefore all wrong by the
