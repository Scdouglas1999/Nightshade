// Wave 7B — Mobile session replay scrubber.
//
// This provider owns the state machine that powers the mobile
// "replay a past session" screen: a single sequence-run id, an
// in-memory merged timeline of events + frame markers, a playhead
// position, and a derived `ReplaySnapshot` stream the UI binds to.
//
// Architecture:
//   * The notifier is created with a runId. On construction it kicks
//     off three concurrent fetches — run header, frames page, events
//     page — against the active NetworkBackend (the local FfiBackend
//     cannot resolve these because the desktop already renders runs
//     directly from its Drift DB; the replay surface is phone-only).
//   * Once the fetches resolve the timeline is materialised: every
//     event becomes a `ReplayMarker.event`, every frame becomes a
//     `ReplayMarker.frame`, and the merged list is sorted by
//     `timestampMs` ascending. This sorted list is the source of truth
//     for everything else.
//   * The playhead is an offset (in ms) from the run's `startedAt`.
//     `seekTo(ms)` clamps to [0, durationMs] and updates the state;
//     `play()` schedules a periodic ticker that advances the playhead
//     at the configured `playbackSpeed`.
//   * `snapshotStream` derives a `ReplaySnapshot` from the markers at
//     or before the playhead. Implemented as a `BehaviorSubject`-style
//     broadcast controller so the widget can `StreamBuilder` it
//     without re-running the scan on every rebuild.
//
// The notifier is intentionally implementation-agnostic about the
// backend: tests inject a `SessionReplayDataSource` that returns
// canned data. Production wiring constructs the data source from the
// app's `NetworkBackend` at the screen layer (see the mobile
// `session_replay_screen.dart`).
