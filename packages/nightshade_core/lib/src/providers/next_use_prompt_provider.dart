/// surface to the user once their rig is ready to image.
///
/// Where [readinessReportProvider] answers "is the rig *ready*?", this layer
/// answers the next question: "now that you're ready, what should you *do*
/// first?" It walks [kNextUseSteps] in teaching order and surfaces the first
/// action the user has neither completed nor explicitly dismissed.
///
/// ## Pure core + thin wiring
///
/// All eligibility *rules* live in [selectNextUseStep], a pure function with no
/// Riverpod / I/O dependencies, so they are exhaustively unit-testable in
/// isolation (mirroring the pure stance of `buildReadinessReport`). The
/// [nextUsePromptProvider] below is the only place that touches live providers;
/// it collects the same inputs [selectNextUseStep] expects and forwards them.
///
/// ## Fail-closed contract
///
/// This layer adopts the same posture as [readinessReportProvider]: absence of
/// positive evidence is treated as "not eligible". Concretely, any async input
/// that is still loading or has errored collapses to "not eligible"
/// ([nextUsePromptProvider] returns `null`). We never optimistically surface a
/// prompt — or optimistically mark a step complete — on the strength of data we
/// have not actually read. A genuinely unknown signal must surface as the
/// conservative outcome, not silently degrade.
