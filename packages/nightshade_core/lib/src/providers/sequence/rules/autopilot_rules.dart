/// Two things want the same rig. The autopilot evaluates every tick and will
/// slew, swap targets, or park the mount at dawn; the operator pressing Start
/// in the Sequencer is asking for something else entirely. The two are now
/// arbitrated safely (the autopilot only ever stops the run it dispatched
/// itself), but nothing on the way into a manual run SAID the autopilot was
/// engaged — no banner in the Sequencer and no pre-flight entry — so the first
/// evidence was the mount moving on its own.
///
/// Emitted as a warning: it is legitimate to hand-start a sequence with the
/// scheduler armed (that is how you take a quick calibration frame mid-night),
/// but it must be a decision rather than a surprise.

    // plan the operator built is the fingerprint of that bug returning.
