/// Catches the fail-closed weather gate BEFORE the run wastes a slew.
///
/// The Rust `WeatherUnsafe` trigger is always armed. With weather safety enabled
/// and the fail mode set to `fail_closed`, a rig that has NO weather source
/// (no weather device, no safety monitor) is treated as unsafe the moment the
/// trigger first evaluates — and the configured action is `ParkAndAbort`. The
/// run therefore unparks, slews, takes a frame or two, then parks and aborts.
///
/// The gate is the fail-closed contract working as designed, so the rule's job
/// is to make it visible before it fires: unannounced, the operator learns of
/// it only from the log, typically the next morning, having lost the night.
