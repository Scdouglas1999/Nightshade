// Wave 7 Agent 2 — Validation rules for the LiveStacking node.
//
// A LiveStacking node sitting in a sequence with no sibling exposure
// nodes is silently broken: the executor arms the broadcast, but no
// frames ever arrive to stack. Surface that as a warning so the user
// catches it before the outreach event starts. The port-clash rule
// guards against the configured broadcast port colliding with the
// running headless API server, which would manifest as either "503
// Service Unavailable" on the broadcast (best case) or "the dashboard
// suddenly returns broadcast JPEGs" (worst case). Both are user-
// visible bugs we want to fail loudly at edit time.

/// We define "sibling exposure" broadly — any ExposureNode or
/// SmartExposureNode anywhere in the same enabled sequence. The
/// broadcast service feeds on `FrameAccepted` events from anywhere in
/// the run, so as long as *some* exposure node exists the broadcast
/// has frames to consume. The "no exposure node at all" case is the
