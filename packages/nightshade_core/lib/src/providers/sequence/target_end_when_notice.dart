/// The one place that recognises a target dropped by its own `end_when`, and
/// the one place that words it.
///
/// The native executor checks a TargetHeader's `end_when` before it images
/// anything: when the stop condition is ALREADY true at entry there is no
/// window left, so the whole target is skipped
/// (`native/nightshade_native/sequencer/src/node/logic/target_header.rs`,
/// `emit_end_when_skipped_at_entry`). That skip used to publish nothing at
/// all — a run that dropped an entire target answered `state: "completed"`,
/// `progress: 1.0`, `warningMessages: []` and a `targetBreakdown` the target
/// was absent from, and the only record anywhere was one `WARN` line in the
/// Rust log file.
///
/// ## Why it rides `TriggerFired`
///
/// Nothing failed: a target trigger fired and the executor did exactly what
/// the sequence configured. The sibling refusal for an unevaluable `start_when`
/// publishes `InstructionFailed`, which reaches Dart as a sequencer `Error` —
/// that one IS a failure. Reusing it here would paint the node red, push a
/// running sequence into `recovering`, and send the operator's phone a
/// "Sequence failed" notification for a target that was skipped on purpose.
///
/// ## The split
///
/// Rust supplies the typed facts (which trigger, guarding which target,
/// testing what, and what the executor did); this file composes the operator's
/// sentence — the same division of labour the meridian-flip outcome uses.
