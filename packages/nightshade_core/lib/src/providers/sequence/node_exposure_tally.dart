/// How many frames each exposure node has actually captured — the ONE channel
/// that only exposure-shaped progress can write.
///
/// SEQ-18, fifth look. The node card counted frames by parsing the node's
/// *display string* out of `SequenceProgress.nodeProgressDetail[nodeId]`. That
/// map is a single slot shared by every instruction that reports against the
/// node, and the native executor writes it several times per node from
/// different producers. The waveF log shows exactly how the count died, one
/// millisecond after a four-frame burst finished:
///
/// ```
/// 04:10:05.978257  NodeProgress node=7837c026… instruction=Exposure          progress=100%
/// 04:10:05.978300  NodeProgress node=7837c026… instruction=IntegrationBudget progress=0%
/// 04:10:05.978320  NodeProgress node=9617e5f0… instruction=AdaptiveExposure  progress=0%
/// ```
///
/// `emit_budget_progress` (native `node/instructions/expose.rs`) fires once per
/// successful burst, against the SAME node id, and overwrites both the string
/// detail and the structured detail with an `IntegrationBudget` payload that no
/// exposure parser can read. So the card fell back to frame 0 and printed
/// "0 / 4 frames" with four empty boxes — directly above the four thumbnails
/// the node had just captured. The next node opened with an `AdaptiveExposure`
/// payload at 0%, which reads back as exactly the same "0 / 4 frames", which is
/// why the card could not tell "captured everything" from "captured nothing".
///
/// Four fixes had already been aimed at the reader (the node's status, a 20 s
/// retention window, a second string wording). None of them could work: the
/// number was gone from the provider before any reader ran. This tally is a
/// separate slot, so an unrelated instruction reporting against the node can no
/// longer erase the frames it took.
