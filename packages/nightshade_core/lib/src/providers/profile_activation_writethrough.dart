/// Push the SQLite-active profile into the native (Rust) executor store so the
/// executor's `load_and_set_profile` side effects run.
///
/// SQLite is the single source of truth for profile READS on both master types
/// (desktop GUI + Pi-headless), but the Rust executor still resolves the active
/// profile from its OWN native store. Whenever the active profile changes from
/// the GUI (NOT via the REST `handleLoadProfile`, which already write-throughs),
/// the new active row must be pushed to the native store or headless sequencing
/// would keep stale (or empty) active-profile context.
///
/// Host/desktop-only: in remote (slave) mode the backend is a `NetworkBackend`,
/// which has no native store — callers must gate on `isRemoteModeProvider` (or,
/// like [EquipmentProfilesNotifier], only run this on the local backend branch)
/// and route activation through the host REST path instead.
///
/// [dao], [backend] and [logger] are passed in already-resolved so this core
/// performs NO `ref.read` of its own. That matters when the caller is a
/// notifier whose `build()` watches the profile streams: after the DB active
/// flag flips, reading a provider through that notifier's `ref` would trip
/// Riverpod's "dependency changed before rebuild" guard. Notifier call sites
/// therefore resolve their collaborators BEFORE mutating SQLite and hand them
/// here; the [Ref]/[WidgetRef] convenience wrappers below cover the widget and
/// REST-handler call sites where that ordering constraint does not apply.
///
/// [strict] controls legacy direct write-through callers: false keeps their
/// best-effort behaviour; true logs and rethrows. New activation call sites
/// must use [activateProfileStrictTransactional], which makes native acceptance
/// a prerequisite for every SQLite/UI activation, including interactive taps.

///      SQLite completely untouched — the caller connects nothing and the
///      previous DB active/default selection is preserved exactly.

///      committed. If THAT commit fails, the native store is compensated back to
///      the previous active profile so the two stores agree again, and the
