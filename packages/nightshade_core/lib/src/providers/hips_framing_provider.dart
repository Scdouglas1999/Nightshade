// Component C7 — Riverpod wiring for the Flutter-side GPU HiPS framing tile
// layer.
//
// This file is the *dependency-injection seam* between the framing screen's
// render path and the pure HiPS pipeline assembled in components C4–C6:
//
//   * C5 [HipsTileFetcher] — the HTTP + off-UI-thread decode edge.
//   * C4 [HipsTileCache]    — the bounded LRU of decoded [ui.Image] tiles.
//   * C6 [HipsTileLoader]   — the debounce/dedup/cancel orchestrator that turns
//                             a stream of fast-changing framing viewports into a
//                             small, ordered, non-thrashing set of resident
//                             tiles and exposes a versioned [HipsResidentSnapshot]
//                             the painter composites.
//
// It exposes exactly the provider surface the framing tile widget watches, and
// nothing more. Every provider is overridable so widget/golden tests inject a
// `MockClient`-backed fetcher (and therefore never touch the network), exactly
// the way `framingImageCacheServiceProvider` is overridden today.
//
// ## Platform independence (hard requirement)
//
// None of this touches the planetarium renderer. The HiPS tiles are a
// Flutter-side, GPU-composited layer inside the framing render path
// (`framing_canvas` + the survey-image painter family), so HiPS framing works
// independently of the planetarium screen — the framing background is its own
// render path.
//
// ## Ownership and lifetime
//
// The cache and fetcher are *owned by the loader*: [HipsTileLoader.dispose]
// disposes the cache (and the fetcher, because the loader is constructed with
// `ownsFetcher: true`). To avoid a double-dispose, [hipsTileCacheProvider] and
// [hipsTileFetcherProvider] create their instances but do **not** register their
// own `onDispose` — they hand the single owned reference to the loader, and the
// autoDispose loader provider disposes the loader (and through it the cache +
// fetcher) when the last listener goes away. Tests that override the cache or
// fetcher therefore still get correct single-ownership disposal through the
// loader.
//
// ## Errors are a feature
//
// The loader surfaces every genuine (non-cancellation) tile failure to its
// injected [HipsTileLoaderErrorSink] (defaulting to `dart:developer` logging)
// *and* records it in [HipsResidentSnapshot.failures], so a developer/operator
// sees it and a UI banner can show it. Cancellations (the expected outcome of a
// superseded pan/zoom generation) are dropped quietly. No silent fallbacks.
