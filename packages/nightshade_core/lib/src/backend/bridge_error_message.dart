/// `NightshadeError` is a flutter_rust_bridge freezed union, so its
/// `toString()` is the debug rendering — `NightshadeError.connectionFailed(
/// deviceId: localhost:11111, reason: …)`. Interpolating that into a status
/// line or a snackbar ships the Dart class name, the variant name and the
/// field names as product copy. Every variant carries the sentence the operator
/// needs in one of its fields, so read the field instead.
///
/// UI packages reach this through `package:nightshade_core`; the bridge stays
/// an implementation detail of the backend layer (architecture §1).
