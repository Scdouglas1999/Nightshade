/// Role interface covering image-data operations.
///
/// What this role owns:
///   * Pixel-buffer transforms: stats, auto-stretch, debayer, star-crop
///     extraction, calibration.
///   * FITS write (raw buffer and "save from last capture" fast-path).
///   * Plate solving against a file (in this codebase plate-solve drives
///     centering, polar align, framing — all imaging consumers).
///   * Polar alignment workflows (start/stop TPPA and all-sky/Sharpcap),
///     which are imaging-loop driven (the camera + plate solver are the
///     core dependencies; mount control is just a follower).
///   * Session image enumeration, thumbnails, full-image download for
///     mobile clients.
///
/// What this role deliberately does NOT own:
///   * Capturing exposures — see [DeviceBackend.cameraStartExposure].
///   * Sequencer image grading / quality config — see [SequencerBackend].
///   * Profile / settings — see [ProfileSettingsBackend].
