/// Role interface covering sequencer execution, recovery, and checkpoint state.
///
/// What this role owns:
///   * Sequencer lifecycle: start, stop, pause, resume, skip, reset, load,
///     status, plugin-node verdict, jump-to-node.
///   * Runtime configuration of the executor: dither, location, filter
///     offsets, carry-over integration, autofocus interval, quality grading
///     defaults, reject folder, observer profile, sky brightness, adaptive
///     exposure defaults, cloud-motion telemetry, conditions score, adaptive
///     swap snapshot, simulation mode, devices, safety fail mode, safety
///     poll interval, save path, decision logging, sequence run id.
///   * Recovery loop: try-now, abort, config push, current snapshot, history.
///   * Checkpoint persistence: directory, has/get/save/resume/discard.
///
/// What this role deliberately does NOT own:
///   * Device commands the sequencer issues against drivers — see
///     [DeviceBackend].
///   * Image-time grading transforms — see [ImagingBackend]. The role owns
///     the *configuration* of grading thresholds; the FITS-time gate that
///     runs inside the executor is a Rust concern.
///   * Profile / settings persistence — see [ProfileSettingsBackend].
///
