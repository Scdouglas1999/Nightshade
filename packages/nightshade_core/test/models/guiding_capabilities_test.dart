// Truth table for the guiding capability layer (defect 4/6).
//
// Both the desktop and mobile guiding controls share `GuideControlsPanel` and
// drive every enable/label decision from these getters, so this pure table is
// what guarantees the two surfaces can never disagree about, e.g., whether
// Start is legal. The load-bearing rules:
//   * Start is legal ONLY from a connected, genuinely-idle state (stopped).
//   * paused / calibrating / settling / looping / lost-lock / unknown NEVER
//     offer Start — they offer Stop.
//   * unknown is treated as possibly-live (Stop yes, Start no) so an
//     unrecognised PHD2 state can't falsely re-enable Start.
