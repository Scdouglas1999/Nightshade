/// to a RADIUS. Since HFR = sigma * sqrt(2 ln 2), that overstated every derived
/// FWHM by 17.7%, and it disagreed with the app's own measured FWHM: the native
/// star detector already uses 2.0 (`FWHM_TO_HFR_RATIO` in `imaging/src/stats.rs`
/// carries the same derivation in its comment). So one session's exported CSV
/// and its FITS headers reported different FWHM for the same frames.
