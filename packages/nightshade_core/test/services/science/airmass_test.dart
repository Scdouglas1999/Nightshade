// The product's one airmass model, pinned against published values.
//
// Airmass reaches three published surfaces — the `AIRMASS` card of every FITS
// frame, the `AMASS` column of an AAVSO submission, and the extinction
// coefficient `k` fitted by the photometric-calibration wizard. Those numbers
// are only comparable if one function produces all of them, so this file pins
// that function's values rather than its formula: if someone re-derives a
// formula at a call site, the reference values below are what catches it.
//
// Reference values are the standard-atmosphere relative air masses tabulated
// in the airmass literature (Kasten & Young 1989 Appl. Opt. 28:4735; Young
// 1994 Appl. Opt. 33:1108; Pickering 2002 DIO 12:1). Two conventions matter
// when reading them:
//
//  * Published tables are indexed by APPARENT (refracted) zenith angle.
//    [airmassForTrueAltitude] takes TRUE (geometric) altitude — what a mount
//    reports and what the FITS writer is handed — so near the horizon a table
//    row must be converted before it can be compared. See the h = 5° case.
//  * The zenith-angle secant is the vacuum limit, not the atmosphere: real
//    airmass is always slightly below sec z, and the gap grows with z.
