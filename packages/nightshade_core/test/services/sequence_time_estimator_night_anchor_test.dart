// Regression: a sequence that starts AFTER local midnight was scored against
// the following night.
//
// `calculateObjectVisibility` scans one local-noon-to-noon window and reads
// only the calendar day of the instant it is given. A run beginning at 01:00
// therefore had its rise/transit/set solved for the night that starts twelve
// hours LATER, so every set time came back roughly a day late and the
// "target sets before this block finishes" conflicts that pre-flight exists to
// raise were silently unreachable.
//
// Same root cause as the planetarium's "Best Targets Tonight" card, which
// reported transit times a sidereal day out for the same reason.
