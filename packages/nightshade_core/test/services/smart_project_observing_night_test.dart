// Growth / best-night / re-reference all group folded subs by *observing
// night*, not by UTC calendar day.
//
// The distinction is not cosmetic. Grouping by UTC day is wrong twice over:
//
//   * West of Greenwich every night is labelled a day late — 21:00 EDT is
//     01:00 UTC the following day, so a session whose header reads
//     "2026-07-25 21:00" was charted as "Jul 26".
//   * East of Greenwich (all of Europe and Asia) the 00:00 UTC boundary falls
//     in the MIDDLE of the observing night, so every single night is split into
//     two points and its frame count, integration time and mean weight are
//     halved. "Best night" then reports the better HALF of a night.
//
// The noon-to-noon local rule asserted here is the same one
// TargetProgressService._nightStart and the forecast planner already use.
