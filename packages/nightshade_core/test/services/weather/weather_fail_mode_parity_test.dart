/// FAIL-MODE PARITY).
///
/// This is the Dart half of a truth table pinned on BOTH sides of the FFI. The
/// Rust half is `safety_fail_mode_no_data_resolution_truth_table` in
/// `native/nightshade_native/sequencer/src/executor/mod.rs`. The two
/// implementations — the Dart no-data weather-safety verdict
/// (`noDataFailModeResolution`) and the Rust safety-poll no-data resolution
/// (`safety_fail_mode_no_data_resolution`) — MUST agree on the identical rows:
///
///   failClosed -> unsafe   (Dart verdict: Some(true);  Rust: weather_safe=false)
///   failOpen   -> safe      (Dart verdict: None/abstain; Rust: weather_safe=true)
///   warnOnly   -> preserve  (Dart verdict: None/abstain; Rust: weather_safe unchanged)
///
/// If you change a row here, change it in the Rust test too, or the two
/// implementations have silently drifted. This is the structural guard that
/// keeps the unattended-night fail-closed semantics identical across languages.
