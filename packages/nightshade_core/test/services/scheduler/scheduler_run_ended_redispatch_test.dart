// plan must be able to start from a parked mount (WE-SEQ-N5), and the dawn park
// must answer the same ownership question every other engine-initiated teardown
// answers (Wave E refutation of SEQ-12).
//
// All three are the same defect shape as SEQ-12: `_status.currentTargetId` is
// the LAST THING DISPATCHED, not "the run I own". Only a natural completion
// reaches the engine's trigger stream, so after a failure/abort/operator stop
// the field stays pinned, hysteresis reports isSwitch=false, and the autopilot
// keeps choosing the same target every tick while dispatching nothing.
//
// The sink models the executor (which run is loaded, whether ANY run is in
// flight) rather than counting calls, because both questions — "is the run I
// dispatched still active?" and "is somebody else's run active?" — have to be
// answerable to tell "my run ended, the rig is free" from "the operator took
// the rig back".
