// Who owns the run the autopilot is about to stop?
//
// Adopted from the Wave D refutation of SEQ-12 (scratchpad
// `seq12_race_test.dart`). Two adjacent inputs the original fix did not
// survive:
//
//   1. the operator's Stop racing a dispatch that is still STARTING a run
//      (rather than landing mid-run), which left an orphan sequence exposing
//      with the autopilot showing Idle; and
//   2. the autopilot's own run ending by any path the engine never hears about
//      (operator Stop, abort, failure — only a natural completion reaches the
//      trigger stream), after which `currentTargetId != null` still claimed
//      ownership and the next no-eligible tick stopped the operator's manual
//      sequence.
//
// The sink here models the executor rather than merely counting calls: it
// tracks WHICH run is loaded, so `ownsRun` can be answered the way the real
// `_ExecutorSequenceSink` answers it (owner + loaded plan id + run active).
