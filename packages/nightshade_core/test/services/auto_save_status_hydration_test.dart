/// Regression test: the hydrated "last backup" timestamp must reach listeners.
///
/// `statusStream` seeds late subscribers with the current status, but a listener
/// that attaches BEFORE the lifecycle provider finishes hydrating — which is
/// what happens when the settings Backup screen is built during boot — was
/// handed the pre-hydration status and never heard about the hydrated one,
/// because `start()` mutated `_status` without emitting. The Backup & Restore
/// screen therefore showed "Last Full Backup: Never" on a machine whose
/// `autosave.last_backup_at` had been persisted hours earlier and which had
/// backup files sitting on disk (observed on the Linux desktop build).
