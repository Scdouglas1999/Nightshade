// The headline's two numbers have to be about the same thing.
//
// One night, 4 masters of 3 frames and 6 s each, one master that produced no
// draft. When that master was UNREADABLE it stayed in `masters` and kept
// contributing its seconds, so the report read "Your 3 drafts are ready — 24 s
// integrated" — a draft count that excludes it beside a total that includes it.
// When the same master merely had NO PATH it was diverted to
// `mastersWithoutFile` and the same night read "18 s integrated". Two numbers
// for one practical outcome, decided by which way the master failed.
