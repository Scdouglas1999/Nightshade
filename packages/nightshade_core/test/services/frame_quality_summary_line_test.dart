// SCI-38: the frame inspector graded a frame "Good" and then printed a fault as
// the only reason — "Good — Low star count (39)" on every frame of a clean
// session. The assessor collects every observation it makes into `reasons`,
// including ones that never moved the verdict, and the UI joined them onto the
// label with an em dash, which reads as the reason FOR the grade.
//
// SCI-37: the same assessment carries two numbers that both get called "the
// score" — the recorded `quality_score` and the assessor's `advisoryScore`,
// which is that score minus review penalties. They must be nameable apart.
