// The overnight driver for the delivery retry sweep.
//
// The failure this guards against is a timer that arms twice (two passes over
// one journal, each writing the other's rows) or one that keeps ticking after
// the server it belongs to has stopped. Both are invisible until a destination
// starts receiving the same file twice.
//
// And the failure that made the retry ladder fiction: with one 15-minute tick,
// a row due 60 seconds after a failed attempt waited for the tick. Measured
// against the release bundle, a share that came back 20 seconds after the
// attempt still had nothing written to it 320 seconds past the row's due time.
// The due check is what makes the documented 1 m / 3 m / 9 m real.
