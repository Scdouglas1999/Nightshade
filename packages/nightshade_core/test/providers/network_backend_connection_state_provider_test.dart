/// so the chip falls back to a "not connected" rendering for the
/// desktop/local-FFI and "explicitly disconnected" paths.
///
/// The companion case (`NetworkBackend` produces a live state stream) is
/// exercised by `network_backend_websocket_test.dart::first attempt emits
/// 'connecting'...`, which drives a real backend against a loopback HTTP
/// server. Together they cover the public API without mocking the WS layer
