// The hop that carries per-frame capture truth out of the typed FRB payload
// and into the event `data` map every listener reads.
//
// Why this file exists: an adversarial verifier deleted
// `...frameCaptureToEventData(sequencerEvent.capture)` from BOTH the
// FrameAccepted and FrameRejected arms of
// `ffi_backend/event_mapping.dart::_extractSequencerEventInfo` and the entire
// 5204-test nightshade_core suite stayed green. That spread is the ONLY thing
// moving gain, offset, sensor temperature, cooler power, pointing, pier side,
// focuser and rotator state from the native `FrameContext` onto the map
// `SequenceExecutor._registerSequenceFrame` writes `captured_images` from.
// Drop it in a refactor and every sequenced frame silently goes back to
// landing in the database with those columns NULL while the FITS file written
// microseconds earlier carries all of them.
//
// So this suite asserts the KEYS AND VALUES survive the hop, not that some
// helper stamps a struct from its own argument. The values below are
// deliberately distinct, non-default and non-zero so a payload that arrives
// as `FrameCaptureMetadata()` defaults cannot pass.
