// An upgrade that is interrupted must leave the database where it started, and
// the one migration step that cannot simply be repeated must be able to resume.
//
// `onUpgrade` ran in auto-commit: every statement committed as it ran while
// `user_version` stayed at the OLD number until the whole chain returned. A
// process killed part-way through therefore left a file that was half at the
// new schema and labelled as being entirely at the old one — and the next
// launch re-ran the chain over it, where each step is only as re-runnable as
// its own guard.
//
// The v30 `guide_rms_history` step is the one that had none. It is
// rename-create-copy-drop, and its guard was `guide_rms_history` existing —
// the one name that stops existing at the first statement. A kill after the
// RENAME made every later run skip the block, v34 then created the table empty
// under `IF NOT EXISTS`, and the guiding history stayed in
// `guide_rms_history_v29` where nothing would read it again.
//
// The interruption is planted the same way `first_boot_create_atomicity_test`
// plants one: a colliding object that makes a step throw part-way, which is
// the state a kill leaves without needing to kill anything.
