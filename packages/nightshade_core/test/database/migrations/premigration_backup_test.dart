// An upgrade must leave the operator a copy of the database as it was before
// it ran.
//
// Nothing did. The only copies this codebase ever made were post-hoc: the
// corruption quarantine's `nightshade-corrupt-*.db` and the interrupted-first-
// boot `nightshade-incomplete-*.db`, both of which fire only once a file is
// already unusable. A schema upgrade rewrites tables in place, and a v7 install
// opened once by an older build re-stamps the version down and lets its foreign
// keys cascade over rows the old schema does not know about — so "restore from
// before the upgrade" had no artefact to restore from.
