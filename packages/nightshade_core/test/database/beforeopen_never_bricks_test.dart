// `beforeOpen` writes a post-mortem for a night a previous process died in.
// That report is a courtesy. The database opening is not.
//
// The marker file the report reads names its session by id, and by the time it
// is read that row can be gone — deleted from the sessions list, rotated away
// by the corruption quarantine, replaced by a restore. The report then INSERTs
// a `narrator_events` row against a missing parent under
// `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`, the foreign-key failure is thrown out of
// `beforeOpen`, and drift refuses every later open while the marker stays on
// disk to cause the same failure again. An undamaged database that never opens
// again.
//
// Tested the way the rest of this directory tests open-time behaviour: put the
// file and the marker into the state the crash leaves, open, and read what the
// open did.
