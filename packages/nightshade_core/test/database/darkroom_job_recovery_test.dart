// The v58 crash-recovery contract for `darkroom_jobs`.
//
// A row is only 'running' while a live executor in THIS process holds it, and
// that state lives in memory — so any 'running' row at the moment the database
// opens belongs to a process that died. `beforeOpen` re-queues it with a note,
// exactly as it already does for `sequence_runs`.
//
// Tested the honest way: write the row, close the database, reopen it, and read
// what the reopen did. Mirrors interrupted_run_reconciliation_test.dart.
