// One resolver decides where this instance's data lives.
//
// Live defect (fresh-install audit, 2026-09-01): NIGHTSHADE_DATA_DIR relocated
// the Rust side's persistence and the Dart log directory, and nothing else.
// Catalogs, catalog caches, checkpoints, the sky atlas, staged updates, the
// remote-access token and the push secret went on resolving
// `getApplicationSupportDirectory()` directly, so an instance pointed at its
// own tree still read three fully-populated catalogs out of
// `~/.local/share/com.example.nightshade_desktop/` — and still wrote its
// credentials there. A "fresh install" launched on empty directories was
// therefore only fresh for the halves the env vars happened to cover.
//
// These tests pin the two halves of the contract: the override wins when set,
// and when it is unset the answer is byte-for-byte `path_provider`'s, so a
// real install cannot lose its catalogs or tokens.
