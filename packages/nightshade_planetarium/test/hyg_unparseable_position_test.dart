// A HYG row whose ra/dec column will not parse must be SKIPPED, never loaded
// at RA 0h / Dec 0.
//
// The parser used to coerce an unparseable coordinate to 0, which is a real
// place on the sky in Pisces — the very position the id-0 Sun row is dropped
// for (see hyg_sun_row_test.dart). A truncated export, an encoding glitch or an
// upstream column reorder therefore did not lose a star, it INVENTED one: a
// named entry with a real magnitude sitting at 0h/0°, answering
// brightest-object-in-view queries over that region and offering itself as a
// slew target.
