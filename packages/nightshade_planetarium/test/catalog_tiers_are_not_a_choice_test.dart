// The catalog download offered three tiers that were the same download.
//
// Walked from an empty catalog directory on a fresh install: downloading
// "Essential (~10 MB, ~9,000 stars)" and then "Standard (~30 MB, ~40,000
// stars)" produced BYTE-IDENTICAL files — same SHA-256, 119,614 stars either
// way — because `_downloadCatalog` fetches `hygStarCatalog` / `openNgcCatalog`
// regardless of the `package` argument, which only ever reaches `_saveMetadata`
// as a label. The settings card then read that label back and printed
// "Depth mag <= 6.5" or "mag <= 8.0" for the very same bytes.
//
// The honest fix was to stop offering a choice that does not exist rather than
// invent three datasets. These tests pin that: one dataset, one set of figures,
// and no variant may claim a depth the shipped HYG file cannot deliver.
