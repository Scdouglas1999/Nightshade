// A secondary component of a multiple star never enters the catalogue named
// after its raw row id.
//
// The chart draws the label "Capella"; clicking it must not open a panel headed
// "HYG118360" with the chip "HYG118360" and "mag 1.0". HYG carries the Capella
// system as two rows — id 24549 (hip 24608, proper "Capella", mag 0.08) and id
// 118360 (no hip, no proper name, no Bayer letter, mag 0.96, comp 2,
// comp_primary 24549), the Ab component 9 arcsec away. An unnamed row that
// falls through the name chain to its own id lets search and the object panel
// show a star called "HYG118360" that no chart ever labels.
