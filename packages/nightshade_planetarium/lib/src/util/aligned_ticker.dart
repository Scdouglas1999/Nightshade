/// ## Why the phase matters more than the rate
///
/// A once-a-second clock sounds free, and one of them nearly is. The cost is
/// not the rate, it is the *phase*: Flutter schedules a frame whenever anything
/// marks itself dirty, and the Linux embedder submits a **full-window** frame
/// for each one regardless of how little actually changed (see the note on
/// `_TimeDisplay` in the shell status bar). Two 1 Hz clocks started 400 ms
/// apart therefore cost two full-window frames a second, three cost three —
/// the idle frame rate of the app is the number of independently-phased
/// clocks in the tree, not the rate any one of them runs at.
///
/// This package owns two of Nightshade's three: [ObservationTimeNotifier] and
/// [WallClockNotifier], each of which armed its `Timer.periodic` at whatever
/// instant it was first read. Aligning every clock to the same absolute
/// reference — the epoch-second boundary — makes the ticks land in the same
/// event-loop turn, so Flutter coalesces them into one frame.
///
/// Duplicated from `nightshade_core`'s copy on purpose: this package is a leaf
/// (core depends on *it*, for catalog access), so it cannot import core without
/// making the dependency circular.
///
/// Self-rescheduling rather than [Timer.periodic] so a delayed tick re-aligns
/// on the next one instead of carrying the lag forever.
class AlignedTicker {
  /// Starts ticking immediately; the first tick lands on the next boundary.
  ///
  /// [now] exists so a test can drive the alignment off a virtual clock —
  /// `fakeAsync` moves timers but not [DateTime.now], and the whole property
  /// worth testing is *which instant* the ticks land on.
